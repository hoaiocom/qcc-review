	abstract = {Quantum computing devices are usually demanding on the environment, with high operating conditions and maintenance costs. The supporting quantum computing operation software also has a high professional threshold. These make it more difficult to deploy and use locally. Cloud based quantum computing services will play an important role in computing power in the quantum era. At present, high-quality quantum computing QPU is scarce, which brings access needs of a large number of users. The computing tasks of a single user are too large, resulting in a large number of resources being occupied by a single user for a period of time, affecting the use of other users or tasks. A new quantum computing cloud platform task scheduling scheme is proposed to classify users and tasks and provide differentiated service opportunities. This scheme will enable high priority users to reduce waiting time and get a better experience.},

	abstract = {Smart Cities attract significant attention and investment from government and private entities, leading to their rapid development. With such growth in Smart Cities, data volume and diversity increase due to Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in devices. However, this abundance of data exposes millions of vulnerable devices to cyber threats, risking compromised security and sensitive information. To address these risks, Smart Cities utilize Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs) equipped with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms continuously monitor and protect against security incidents. Although Quantum Computing (QC) has shown promise in Smart City applications, its usage as a service is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose to investigate the utilization of Quantum as a Service (QaaS) to develop an architecture for securing a Smart City. Our approach employs Quantum Classifiers, QBoost from D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud and Variational Quantum Classifier, and PegaSoS Quantum Support Vector Classifier from IBM Quantum Services. These provide real-time data classification and a user-friendly dashboard to display security incidents in the Smart City. Among the three quantum classifiers considered for the proposed architecture, QBoost performed the best both regarding quality and processing time.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging field of high interest. Many companies have started to work on developing more powerful and stable quantum computers. However, developers still struggle to master the art of programming with a quantum computer. One of the major challenges faced is the integration of quantum parts of a system with the classical one. This paper proposes a novel development model called Quantum-Algorithms-as-a-Service (QAaaS). This new model aims to allow developers to abstract the quantum components away from the design of the software they are building. The model leverages Software-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service to support multiple quantum cloud providers and run their algorithms regardless of the underlying hardware.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are currently accessible through a cloud-based platform that allows users to run their programs on a suite of quantum hardware. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ≈ 30\%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ≈ .},

	abstract = {Recent advances in the development of the first generation of quantum computing devices have provided researchers with computational platforms to explore new ideas and reformulate conventional computational codes suitable for a quantum computer. Developers can now implement these reformulations on both quantum simulators and hardware platforms through a cloud computing software environment. For example, the IBM Q Experience provides the direct access to their quantum simulators and quantum computing hardware platforms. However these current access options may not be an optimal environment for developers needing to download and modify the source codes and libraries. This paper focuses on the construction of a Docker container environment with Qiskit source codes and libraries running on a local cloud computing system that can directly access the IBM Q Experience. This prototype container based system allows single user and small project groups to do rapid prototype development, testing and implementation of extreme capability algorithms with more agility and flexibility than can be provided through the IBM Q Experience website. This prototype environment also provides an excellent teaching environment for labs and project assignments within graduate courses in cloud computing and quantum computing. The paper also discusses computer security challenges for expanding this prototype container system to larger groups of quantum computing researchers.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a new paradigm for solving problems that classical computers cannot reach. To the point that it is already generating interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently, quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have already built functional quantum computers, and developed several programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing resources are now becoming easily accessible from various cloud providers. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work.},

Therefore, quantum simulation has become the main assistant method of verifying quantum algorithms. Grover's quantum search algorithm can speed up many classical algorithms that use search heuristics. In this work, a high performance Grover algorithm simulation is proposed combining the characteristics of Grover's algorithm and the parallelism of cloud computing, which dramatically improves the performance of the load balancing among multi-core, the utilization of memory space and the efficiency of simulation. Moreover, We propose five different computing configurations in the cloud environment suitable for quantum simulation and compare them through experimentation. We also validate the effectiveness of optimization by analysis and experimentation. The experimentation shows the simulation can reach 31 bits depending on the scale of current configuration.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has entered its mature life thanks to the availability of cloud-based Noisy Intermediate -Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies. These devices allow quantum researchers and practitioners to design, develop and test quantum algorithms on actual hardware, paving the way toward new approaches in solving problems intractable by classical computers. However, in spite of these achievements in quantum technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ devices. As a consequence, there is a strong need of introducing innovative computing architectures able to interconnect a set of NISQ devices to increase the capabilities of current quantum computers of solving hard problems in a reliable way. In this paper, the concept of Distributed Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (D-NISQ) is introduced as a reference computational model by which designing innovative frameworks where quantum devices interact to solve a complex problem by working cooperatively. In detail, the D-NISQ model consists of a hybrid and hierarchical architecture where classical and quantum processors interact to iteratively split up a problem into a collection of sub-problems, solve each one of them by means of a proper quantum algorithm, and fuse output quantum information so as to compute the final solution to the problem posed. As demonstrated by two case studies based on the well-known Grover's algorithm, a multi-threaded implementation of the D-NISQ reference model allows for greater reliability in solving problems by quantum computation.},

However, quantum versions of classical machine learning algorithms introduce a plethora of additional parameters and circuit variations that have their own intricacies in being tuned. In this work, we take the first steps towards Automated Quantum Machine Learning (AutoQML). We propose a concrete description of the problem, and then develop a classical-quantum hybrid cloud architecture that allows for parallelized hyperparameter exploration and model training. As an application use-case, we train a quantum Generative Adversarial neural Network (qGAN) to generate energy prices that follow a known historic data distribution.

Cloud based quantum computing services will play an important role in computing power in the quantum era. At present, high-quality quantum computing QPU is scarce, which brings access needs of a large number of users. The computing tasks of a single user are too large, resulting in a large number of resources being occupied by a single user for a period of time, affecting the use of other users or tasks.

With such growth in Smart Cities, data volume and diversity increase due to Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in devices. However, this abundance of data exposes millions of vulnerable devices to cyber threats, risking compromised security and sensitive information. To address these risks, Smart Cities utilize Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs) equipped with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms continuously monitor and protect against security incidents. Although Quantum Computing (QC) has shown promise in Smart City applications, its usage as a service is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose to investigate the utilization of Quantum as a Service (QaaS) to develop an architecture for securing a Smart City. Our approach employs Quantum Classifiers, QBoost from D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud and Variational Quantum Classifier, and PegaSoS Quantum Support Vector Classifier from IBM Quantum Services. These provide real-time data classification and a user-friendly dashboard to display security incidents in the Smart City. Among the three quantum classifiers considered for the proposed architecture, QBoost performed the best both regarding quality and processing time.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are currently accessible through a cloud-based platform that allows users to run their programs on a suite of quantum hardware. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ≈ 30\%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ≈ .},

	abstract = {As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain. Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {In the dynamic field of quantum computing, characterized by constant innovation and continuous advancement of hardware and software capabilities, it is clear that this emerging technology holds immense potential in fields such as medicine and security. However, as the quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers. In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance, and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6\% when the load balancer is employed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92\%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services.

	abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging area that yearly improves and develops more advances in the number of qubits and the available infrastructure for public users. Nowadays, the main cloud service providers (CSP) are implementing different mechanisms to support access to their quantum computers, which can be used to perform small experiments, test hybrid algorithms and prove quantum theories. Recent research work have discussed the low capacity of using quantum computers in a single CSP to perform quantum computation that are needed to solve different experiments for real world problems. Thus, there are needs for computing powers in the form of qubits from multi-cloud environment. Quantum computing in a multi-cloud environment requires security of the communicating channels. A well known algorithm in quantum cryptography for this purpose is the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. To address the low capacity issue, this research develops and tests the use of heterogeneous quantum computers located on different CSP to distribute quantum calculations between them by leveraging the channel security provided by the QKD protocol. The achieved results show over 88.1\% of correct distributed quantum computation results without error correction methods, 96.8\% of correct distributed quantum computation results using error correction methods and over 98.8\% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments. This demonstrates that quantum calculations can be distributed between different CSP while securing the channel with the QKD protocol at the same time. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges, especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holistic Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and the state-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation application development in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum system to streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combining hybrid quantum–classical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adapting DevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiple well-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q\#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloud providers (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket). This paper proposes the concept of quantum function-as-a-service, system design, operation workflows, implementation of QFaaS, and lessons learned on the benefits and limitations of quantum serverless computing. We also present practical use cases with various quantum applications on today's quantum computers and simulators to demonstrate our framework capability to facilitate the ongoing quantum software transition. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the sub circuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for Preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML. © 2024 IEEE.},

However, even after 25+ years, researchers still struggle with stable error correction solutions for delivering a stable commercialised quantum universal quantum machine. Companies like IBM, Rigetti, and D-Wave have already started offering quantum annealers, intermediate quantum devices based on the qubit. Therefore, researchers believe that QC would be introduced as an extension of classical computers (CC), where CC would offload a specific computational intensive task. Cloud companies, including Amazon, Azure, and IBM, have already begun to provide cloud services where an organisation can use a QC to work on potential applications.

	abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs. © 2023 IEEE.},

This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18\% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7\% (up to 36.7\%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time.

	abstract = {The cloud services requiring communication, computing and caching (3C) resources are supported by datacenter networks (DCNs). The service security is threatened due to the development of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) technology promises to share secret keys as cipher resources between remote users with information-Theoretic security. The quantum cloud is illustrated which is realized by the QKD-secured cloud datacenter network. In the quantum cloud, the communication, computing, caching and cipher (4C) resources are provided for data transmission, processing, storing and encryption. To solve the newly emerged 4C resource coordination problem, a 4C-oriented control architecture is designed and the heuristic algorithms for securing service function chains are innovatively proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve the great service success ratio performance compared with the baseline. © 2023 IFIP.},

	abstract = {As quantum computers mature, the complexity of quantum software increases. As we move from the initial standalone quantum algorithms toward complex solutions combining quantum algorithms with traditional software, new software engineering methods and abstractions are needed. Nowadays, quantum computers are usually offered in the cloud, under a pay-per-use model, leading to the adoption of the service-oriented good practices that dominate the cloud today. However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway-an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time. As proof of concept, we provide an implementation of the Quantum API Gateway for the Amazon Braket platform. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add functionality using any language or environment.

As the technology develops to a point of maturity that allows quantum computers to expand commercially, large companies such as Google, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon are making a considerably effort to make them accessible through the cloud so that research and industry initiatives can test their capabilities. The characteristics of this paradigm and the lack of mature tools still make the process of defining, implementing, and running quantum, or hybrid classical-quantum software systems difficult compared with the procedures used for pure classical ones. To address this lack, we present a demonstration of a method for defining quantum services and the automatic generation of the corresponding source code through an extension of the Open API Specification. In this demo we present an extension that enables developers to define quantum services with a high abstraction level, link them with quantum circuits, and generate the source code of the service to be deployed in a quantum computer in the same way they do for classical services. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Smart Cities are becoming a reality now with ample interest and investment from both government and private entities. As the number of Smart Cities increases, so does the sheer size and variety of data, the major part of which comes from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors embedded in devices. Millions of intelligent devices may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or threats, potentially harming one or more connected devices or exposing sensitive data. Therefore, Smart Cities have Intelligent Operations Centers (IOC), using different machine learning (ML) algorithms to monitor the data and take necessary actions to protect or contain any security incident. The advent of Quantum Computing (QC) has led to many initiatives for using QC in various applications of a Smart City but using Quantum Computing as a service is not yet fully contemplated in this context. In this work, we propose an architecture for Smart City security using Quantum as a Service (QaaS) for analyzing and classifying Smart City data. The proposed architecture uses two different Quantum Classifiers, implemented in the D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud (QBoost) and IBM Quantum Services (Variational Quantum Classifier), for real-time classification of data and displays security incidents on a conveniently designed dashboard for further actions by the Security Operations Center (SOC) specialist. Further experiments have shown that D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud-based QBoost performed the best among the quantum classifiers both regarding quality and time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

It is a fact that Quantum computing will adequately innovate the computation perspective. However, it is not a feasible solution yet as it is likely to be rare and highly expensive to produce. This paper presents a Quantum Cloud-as-a-service for an efficient, scalable, and secure solution for complex Smart Healthcare computations.

These HQC algorithms help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources. © 2023 IEEE.},

CC has emerged as an on-demand accessible tool in different practical applications such as digital industry, academics, manufacturing, health sector, and others. Backup, security, processing, and localization are all issues that the cloud is dealing with. As a result, quantum computing has seen tremendous growth in several domains. In literature, the majority of those researchers working on quantum believe it will solve the cloud service issues. Quantum cloud computing (QCC) entails the deployment of quantum computation sources in a cloud environment to overcome the following challenges and concerns that the existing model of simple cloud computation faces. However, not everyone is interested in combining physics-based atomic computing with software-based CC. This study will demonstrate all of the probable benefits and drawbacks of quantum computing (QC) when used in conjunction with a cloud system. The same also cover some of the most recent updates, as well as some uncertain prospects for quantum as a cloud service.

Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work. © 2023 IEEE.},

Quantum computing relies on various types of processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them. Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum computing software projects have significantly increased in areas where complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems, quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy, security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM’s existing Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach with advanced quantum cloud services.

	abstract = {As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion 'shots' or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems. © 2021 IEEE.},

Unfortunately, however, existing solutions typically implicitly assume intimate knowledge about quantum computing concepts and operators. This vision paper introduces Quantum Service-Oriented Computing (QSOC), a model for building applications using a well-balanced mix of classical and quantum (hybrid) computing approaches. We propose a model-driven methodology that allows application developers, classical service developers, and quantum programmers to build hybrid enterprise applications collaboratively. As a result, quantum programmers and service developers can develop and publish quantum and classical components. At the same time, the application developers can discover, compose, configure and compose pre-built components to build and operate enterprise applications without intimate knowledge on the underlying quantum infrastructure, advocating knowledge reuse and separation of concerns. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users’ selection in a ‘win–lose’ manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ‘win–win’ manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Access to a programmable CMOS-compatible Silicon spin qubit-based quantum processor will be provided in the next deployment phase. The first generation of QI's quantum processors consists of a double quantum dot hosted in an in-house grown SiGe/28Si/SiGe heterostructure, and defined with a single layer of Al gates. Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI's modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit. We close with a section on QI's qubit calibration framework.

	abstract = {Quantum communication relies on the existence of entanglement between two nodes of a network. However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware. In this paper, we report the circuit-level implementation of the complete architecture of a quantum repeater and benchmark this protocol on IBM’s cloud quantum computer—IBMQ. Our experiments indicate a 26\% fidelity of shared bell pairs for a complete on-chip quantum repeater with a yield of 49\%. We also compare these results with simulation data from IBM Qiskit. The results of our experiments provide a quantitative measure for the fidelity of entanglement that currently available repeaters can establish. In addition, the proposed circuit implementation provides a robust benchmark for state-of-the-art quantum computing hardware. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this 'quantum advantage', a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Existing classical ciphertext retrieval schemes are mainly developed according to the homomorphic encryption that is a cryptographic technique based on computational complexity theory of mathematical puzzles. In quantum computing, on the one hand, most of traditional asymmetric encryption can be quickly cracked as the computational capacity of quantum computer is much higher than that of traditional digital computer. Hence, the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme is widely used in data encryption for the issue of privacy protection in quantum computing. But on the other the retrieval efficiency of homomorphic encrypted data is insufficient especially in quantum cloud computing. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel quantum homomorphic encryption ciphertext retrieval (QHECR) scheme basing on the Grover algorithm to solve the problem of homomorphic encrypted ciphertext data retrieval in quantum cloud computing. Our scheme is to improve such retrieval efficiency mentioned above where the interaction process is not required even if the T-gate exists in the circuit. In the experiment, two qubits without the T-gate are conducted on both simulations and real quantum devices by using IBM quantum information science kit (Qiskit). The results show that the proposed QHECR scheme is capable of achieving the retrieval encrypted data when the T-gate does not exist in the evaluation circuit in ciphertext environment. Moreover, a verification experiment about the T-gate key update algorithm is implemented to verify the feasibility and reliability of the proposed scheme in the Qiskit as well, which indicates that the QHECR is still available when the T-gate exists in the circuit. Since the decryption is inefficient when there are exponential T-gates in the circuit, our proposed scheme is suitable for low T-gate complexity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In our study, we conducted a research on some services to test and evaluate the performances of different cloud quantum computing services and make a comparison out of it. The test will be conducted using two different methods such as visual programming and qiskit. From the result, we can see that the amount of qubit per backend and shots per run pretty much affect the execution time of a cloud quantum computing.

	abstract = {Nowadays, data transfer has been vast online and on social media. Hence data security in the various cloud environments has been enabled to send and receive data. While transferring the data, some issues in the cloud environment are the lack of connectivity, control, and the insecurity of the password and the data. To handle this problem, data security and the internet connection have to be enabled for the cloud environments. The method of homomorphic encryption and the transport layer security protocol have been enabled for the analysis. The homomorphic encryption method converts the data to the ciphertext for making the text in the original format. Then the transport layer security protocol is used to authenticate the data, and the data integrity of the communication can be executed. The proposed system performs better than current protocols like Dynamic Level Based Integrity Checking Protocol, TLS protocol, and Lightweight Cryptosystem, making it a potential option for jobs involving safe and effective cloud information processing. Overall, the proposed Two-tier Homomorphic Encryption system exhibits improved execution time, security strength, resource utilization, communication overhead, and user satisfaction. It addresses issues such as connectivity gaps, control deficiencies, and password and data insecurity, making it an effective method for boosting cloud security in quantum cloud computing environments.},

	abstract = {The popularity of cloud computing platforms has risen dramatically in recent years. As cloud computing serves millions of users at the same time, it must be able to handle all those users' demands efficiently. Thus, choosing a suitable scheduling algorithm is crucial in the cloud computing environment in order to ensure efficient performance with a reasonable degree of quality of service (QoS). The primary goal of this research is to empirically implement and evaluate a recently proposed Round-Robin algorithm with smart time quantum (RR-STQ) in a cloud computing environment, as well as, to enhance the RR-STQ with a dynamic smart time quantum. The CloudSim tool was used to simulate the cloud computing platform to implement RR-STQ and evaluate it with several algorithms using different scenarios. In addition, three scheduling performance metrics were used in the evaluation process. In all comparison scenarios, the (RR-STQ) achieved a significant improvement rate in terms of average response time (RT). Moreover, (RR-STQ) has a better performance in the average turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), and response time (RT) than the traditional RR algorithm. Also, the implemented algorithm (RR-STQ) with dynamic time quantum has a better performance than static time quantum. Based on the evaluation results, it is beneficial to integrate the RR algorithm with other scheduling models such as shortest job first (SJF) to enhance the WT and TAT. Furthermore, the investigations revealed that the dynamic time quantum improves the performance of the RR algorithm.},

For this application, a compact embedded processor board handles simple operations like data acquisition and pre-processing while a quantum cloud server is used to perform quantum computing simulations. This experimental setup is well suited for quantum computing as it is not feasible to embed a quantum processor at the edge, but practical to interface embedded processor boards to a quantum cloud server for processing massive audio data for a variety of recognition tasks. We found that distributing the task between the embedded processor and quantum sever enabled the application of QNN's to live audio data at the expense of system response time.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a promising paradigm to solve computationally intractable problems. Various companies such as, IBM, Rigetti and D-Wave offer quantum computers using a cloud-based platform that possess several interesting features namely, (i) quantum hardware with various number of qubits and coupling maps exist at the cloud end that offer different computing capabilities; (ii) multiple hardware with identical coupling maps exist in the suite; (iii) coupling map of larger hardware with more number of qubits can fit the coupling map of many smaller hardware; (iv) the quality of each of the hardware is distinct; (v) user cannot validate the origination of the result obtained from a quantum hardware. In other words, the user relies on the scheduler of the cloud provider to allocate the requested hardware; (vi) the queue of quantum programs at the cloud end is typically long and maximizing the throughput, which is the key to reducing costs and helping the scientific community in their explorations. The above factors motivate a new threat model with following possibilities: (a) in future, less-trustworthy quantum computers from 3rd parties can allocate poor quality hardware to save on cost or towards satisfying their falsely-advertised qubit or quantum hardware specifications; (b) the workload scheduling algorithm could have a bug or malicious code segment which will try to maximize throughput at the cost of allocation to poor fidelity hardware. Such bugs are possible for trustworthy providers; (c) a rogue employee in trusted cloud vendor could try to sabotage the vendor's reputation by degrading the user compute fidelity just by tampering with the scheduling algorithm or rerouting the program; (d) a rogue employee can steal information by redirecting the programs to a 3rd party quantum hardware where they have full control. If the allocated hardware is inferior in quality, the user will suffer from poor quality result or longer convergence time. We propose two flavors of a Quantum Physically Unclonable Function (QuPUF) to address this issue- one based on superposition and another based on decoherence. Our experiments on real quantum hardware reveal that temporal variations in qubit quality can degrade the quality of the proposed QuPUF. We add a parametric rotation to the QuPUF for stability. Experiments on real IBM quantum hardware show that the proposed QuPUF can achieve inter-die Hamming Distance (HD) of 55\% and intra-HD as low as 4\%, as compared to ideal cases of 50\% and 0\% respectively. The proposed QuPUFs can also be used as a standalone solution for any other application.},

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, the emergence of cloud-based quantum services has opened up access to this cutting-edge technology for a broader user base. As demand for these services grows, the efficient and timely delivery of quantum computing capabilities becomes increasingly critical. However, current queuing methods for executing quantum tasks on specific machines often lead to inefficient resource usage and longer waiting times. In this paper, we present Moirai, a quantum serverless function orchestration framework to reduce the maximum completion time and improve device utilization. Leveraging the unique properties of quantum circuits, Moirai introduces a customized circuit representation scheme, incorporating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) conversion and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embedding vector feature extraction. Central to Moirai is the use of reinforcement learning, which drives a suite of decision pipelines for device allocation and circuit deployment strategy. We conduct extensive evaluations involving 95 prevalent quantum algorithm circuits across 3∼7 qubits, utilizing 10 IBM quantum physical devices with three types of chip topologies. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances resource allocation efficiency and overall performance, achieving a noteworthy reduction in execution time of over 30\% compared to baseline methods. This underscores the effect of Moirai as a practical solution for optimizing quantum cloud services and unlocking the potential of quantum computing technology.},

But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

It has allowed for a breakthrough in using random numbers that are unpredictable. The main goal of the project to design a system including the QRNG (quantum random number generator) and cloud platform developed by IBM. The system produces robust and ideal output for cryptography while being both effective and efficient. We will conduct detailed and effective tuning and testing so as to increase output. Outputs of this project are a QRNG system built on the cloud that can be connected with cryptographic applications, certified sequence, and informational materials of the organization. With this research of QRNGs synchronized with the IBM cloud platform, we make cryptographic security stronger by using the quantum mechanical method to create truly random numbers. Moreover, QRNGs contribute to the cryptographic applications which are intended to be incredibly secure and of high dependability by providing random numbers to enter the realm of crypto-with very little human participation. Basically, the cloud-based architecture enable systems to scale and possible failure resilience via migrating the workload or storing the data online. Quantum improvements will speed up the process of replacing the currently accepted cryptographic paradigm with something opening new ways of digital communication.

	abstract = {Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is 39\% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7\% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4\% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios.},

In this study, publicly free quantum backends in the IBM quantum experience environment are discussed. The study includes a comparative explanation of the factors affecting the performance of quantum computers. Quantum circuits were created in the IBM Composer environment and then run on the appropriate backend. Quantum circuits of 4mod5, which finds whether a 4-bit number is divisible by 5, 1-bitadder that performs 1-bit addition with the carry bit, and gray code, which finds the gray code equivalent of the binary number, were created. The created circuits were run on 8 different IBMQ backends and the results were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that while the simplicity of the gates used increases the performance rates, there may be different backends that operate each quantum circuit more accurately. It is hoped that the study will be a guide for researchers working on applied quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is currently moving from an academic idea to a practical reality. Quantum computing in the cloud is already available and allows users from all over the world to develop and execute real quantum algorithms. However, companies which are heavily investing in this new technology such as Google, IBM, Rigetti, Intel, IonQ, and Xanadu follow diverse technological approaches. This led to a situation where we have substantially different quantum computing devices available thus far. They mostly differ in the number and kind of qubits and the connectivity between them. Because of that, various methods for realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum computing device are available. This paper provides an introduction and overview into this domain and describes corresponding methods, also referred to as compilers, mappers, synthesizers, transpilers, or routers.},

	doi = {10.1109/EDOC49727.2020.00024},
	abstract = {Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently. Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.},

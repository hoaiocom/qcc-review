	abstract = {The quantum cloud computing paradigm presents unique challenges in task placement due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of quantum computation resources. Traditional heuristic approaches fall short in adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of quantum computing. This paper proposes DRLQ, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)- based technique for task placement in quantum cloud computing environments, addressing the optimization of task completion time and quantum task scheduling efficiency. It leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture, enhanced with the Rainbow DQN approach, to create a dynamic task placement strategy. This approach is one of the first in the field of quantum cloud resource management, enabling adaptive learning and decision-making for quantum cloud environments and effectively optimizing task placement based on changing conditions and resource availability. We conduct extensive experiments using the QSimPy simulation toolkit to evaluate the performance of our method, demonstrating substantial improvements in task execution efficiency and a reduction in the need to reschedule quantum tasks. Our results show that utilizing the DRLQ approach for task placement can significantly reduce total quantum task completion time by 37.81 \% to 72.93\% and prevent task rescheduling attempts compared to other heuristic approaches. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain. Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {In the dynamic field of quantum computing, characterized by constant innovation and continuous advancement of hardware and software capabilities, it is clear that this emerging technology holds immense potential in fields such as medicine and security. However, as the quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers. In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance, and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6\% when the load balancer is employed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {The integration of Quantum Computers (QC) within High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments holds significant promise for solving real-world problems by leveraging the strengths of both computational paradigms. However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92\%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services.

	abstract = {Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is 39\% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7\% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4\% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging area that yearly improves and develops more advances in the number of qubits and the available infrastructure for public users. Nowadays, the main cloud service providers (CSP) are implementing different mechanisms to support access to their quantum computers, which can be used to perform small experiments, test hybrid algorithms and prove quantum theories. Recent research work have discussed the low capacity of using quantum computers in a single CSP to perform quantum computation that are needed to solve different experiments for real world problems. Thus, there are needs for computing powers in the form of qubits from multi-cloud environment. Quantum computing in a multi-cloud environment requires security of the communicating channels. A well known algorithm in quantum cryptography for this purpose is the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. To address the low capacity issue, this research develops and tests the use of heterogeneous quantum computers located on different CSP to distribute quantum calculations between them by leveraging the channel security provided by the QKD protocol. The achieved results show over 88.1\% of correct distributed quantum computation results without error correction methods, 96.8\% of correct distributed quantum computation results using error correction methods and over 98.8\% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments. This demonstrates that quantum calculations can be distributed between different CSP while securing the channel with the QKD protocol at the same time. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges, especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holistic Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and the state-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation application development in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum system to streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combining hybrid quantum–classical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adapting DevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiple well-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q\#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloud providers (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket). This paper proposes the concept of quantum function-as-a-service, system design, operation workflows, implementation of QFaaS, and lessons learned on the benefits and limitations of quantum serverless computing. We also present practical use cases with various quantum applications on today's quantum computers and simulators to demonstrate our framework capability to facilitate the ongoing quantum software transition. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the sub circuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for Preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML. © 2024 IEEE.},

This paper systematically analyses the need to provide QC as a service (QCaaS) for potential applications. Furthermore, we discuss the framework on which this service can be offered. Subsequently, we provide a detailed discussion of various toolkits, libraries, and simulators available for QC. © 2024 World Scientific Publishing Co.},

	abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We introduce a secure hardware device named a QEnclave that can secure the remote execution of quantum operations while only using classical controls. This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are widely used for quantum computing (QC) from quantum cloud providers. Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18\% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7\% (up to 36.7\%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines. © 2020 IEEE.},

With the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum computing. However, the limited quantity, quality, and accessibility of quantum resources pose significant challenges to practical research in quantum software and systems. To address these challenges, we propose iQuantum, a first-of-its-kind simulation toolkit that can model quantum computing environments for prototyping and evaluating system design and scheduling algorithms. This paper presents the quantum computing system model, architectural design, proof-of-concept implementation, potential use cases, and future development of iQuantum.

As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-As-A-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-Trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ≈ 30\%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ≈ . © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing shows immense potential for solving traditional, near to impossible, complex problems. It also shows how the performance and speed can be improved for the solution of existing classical problems by using quantum mechanics. However, the computation power of current computers, servers, and supercomputers is well enough to speed up the existing problem solutions. But as data generated from various resources increases rapidly, in current scenarios more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is generated daily and is expected to be 200+ zettabytes on the cloud by 2025. Handling and storing such a massive amount of data is a significant issue for current computing and storage devices. Quantum computing has the capability to resolve this issue with quantum rules. In this paper, the task of pattern finding and recognizing in data (i.e., machine learning) is explored with the help of quantum computing and introducing a collaborative learning architecture. It enables collaborative computation from heterogeneous quantum computing devices for machine learning tasks. Also, it can be adapted to any quantum machine learning approach and speed up the learning phase with better data privacy. The proposed scheme is implemented with the MNIST dataset to compare with current existing research work. Results show that the proposed architecture matches existing research work’s performance with the additional features of privacy and heterogeneity of quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Smart Cities are becoming a reality now with ample interest and investment from both government and private entities. As the number of Smart Cities increases, so does the sheer size and variety of data, the major part of which comes from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors embedded in devices. Millions of intelligent devices may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or threats, potentially harming one or more connected devices or exposing sensitive data. Therefore, Smart Cities have Intelligent Operations Centers (IOC), using different machine learning (ML) algorithms to monitor the data and take necessary actions to protect or contain any security incident. The advent of Quantum Computing (QC) has led to many initiatives for using QC in various applications of a Smart City but using Quantum Computing as a service is not yet fully contemplated in this context. In this work, we propose an architecture for Smart City security using Quantum as a Service (QaaS) for analyzing and classifying Smart City data. The proposed architecture uses two different Quantum Classifiers, implemented in the D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud (QBoost) and IBM Quantum Services (Variational Quantum Classifier), for real-time classification of data and displays security incidents on a conveniently designed dashboard for further actions by the Security Operations Center (SOC) specialist. Further experiments have shown that D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud-based QBoost performed the best among the quantum classifiers both regarding quality and time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These HQC algorithms help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources. © 2023 IEEE.},

CC has emerged as an on-demand accessible tool in different practical applications such as digital industry, academics, manufacturing, health sector, and others. Backup, security, processing, and localization are all issues that the cloud is dealing with. As a result, quantum computing has seen tremendous growth in several domains. In literature, the majority of those researchers working on quantum believe it will solve the cloud service issues. Quantum cloud computing (QCC) entails the deployment of quantum computation sources in a cloud environment to overcome the following challenges and concerns that the existing model of simple cloud computation faces. However, not everyone is interested in combining physics-based atomic computing with software-based CC. This study will demonstrate all of the probable benefits and drawbacks of quantum computing (QC) when used in conjunction with a cloud system. The same also cover some of the most recent updates, as well as some uncertain prospects for quantum as a cloud service.

Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work. © 2023 IEEE.},

Quantum computing relies on various types of processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them. Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum computing software projects have significantly increased in areas where complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems, quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy, security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM’s existing Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach with advanced quantum cloud services.

And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion 'shots' or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems.

Unfortunately, however, existing solutions typically implicitly assume intimate knowledge about quantum computing concepts and operators. This vision paper introduces Quantum Service-Oriented Computing (QSOC), a model for building applications using a well-balanced mix of classical and quantum (hybrid) computing approaches. We propose a model-driven methodology that allows application developers, classical service developers, and quantum programmers to build hybrid enterprise applications collaboratively. As a result, quantum programmers and service developers can develop and publish quantum and classical components. At the same time, the application developers can discover, compose, configure and compose pre-built components to build and operate enterprise applications without intimate knowledge on the underlying quantum infrastructure, advocating knowledge reuse and separation of concerns. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {We model the hardware and software architecture for generalized Internet of Things (IoT) by quantum cloud-computing and blockchain. To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users’ selection in a ‘win–lose’ manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ‘win–win’ manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI's modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit.

	abstract = {Quantum communication relies on the existence of entanglement between two nodes of a network. However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware. In this paper, we report the circuit-level implementation of the complete architecture of a quantum repeater and benchmark this protocol on IBM’s cloud quantum computer—IBMQ. Our experiments indicate a 26\% fidelity of shared bell pairs for a complete on-chip quantum repeater with a yield of 49\%. We also compare these results with simulation data from IBM Qiskit. The results of our experiments provide a quantitative measure for the fidelity of entanglement that currently available repeaters can establish. In addition, the proposed circuit implementation provides a robust benchmark for state-of-the-art quantum computing hardware. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this 'quantum advantage', a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Existing classical ciphertext retrieval schemes are mainly developed according to the homomorphic encryption that is a cryptographic technique based on computational complexity theory of mathematical puzzles. In quantum computing, on the one hand, most of traditional asymmetric encryption can be quickly cracked as the computational capacity of quantum computer is much higher than that of traditional digital computer. Hence, the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme is widely used in data encryption for the issue of privacy protection in quantum computing. But on the other the retrieval efficiency of homomorphic encrypted data is insufficient especially in quantum cloud computing. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel quantum homomorphic encryption ciphertext retrieval (QHECR) scheme basing on the Grover algorithm to solve the problem of homomorphic encrypted ciphertext data retrieval in quantum cloud computing. Our scheme is to improve such retrieval efficiency mentioned above where the interaction process is not required even if the T-gate exists in the circuit. In the experiment, two qubits without the T-gate are conducted on both simulations and real quantum devices by using IBM quantum information science kit (Qiskit). The results show that the proposed QHECR scheme is capable of achieving the retrieval encrypted data when the T-gate does not exist in the evaluation circuit in ciphertext environment. Moreover, a verification experiment about the T-gate key update algorithm is implemented to verify the feasibility and reliability of the proposed scheme in the Qiskit as well, which indicates that the QHECR is still available when the T-gate exists in the circuit. Since the decryption is inefficient when there are exponential T-gates in the circuit, our proposed scheme is suitable for low T-gate complexity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based on execution time estimations.Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by over 40\% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers. © 2021 IEEE.},

The proposed secure quantum information exchange protocol can resist intercept-and-resend attack, intercept-and-measure attack, intercept-and-entangle auxiliary attack and denial-of-service attack. It can also be generalised to N-party case that is feasible and efficient. Copyright © 2018 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

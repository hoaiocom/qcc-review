	abstract = {Quantum computing is a rapidly progressing field: quantum computers are becoming more powerful and an increasing number of functionalities are offered via various quantum platforms and quantum software packages. Current quantum computers can be used almost exclusively via cloud services. It is expected that this will remain the case, at least in the near-term future. For successful adoption of quantum computing by the market, quantum cloud services should be user-centric. To that end, we explore quantum cloud computing from a user perspective. We describe a standardised overview of quantum cloud computing as a whole to create a common language to strengthen research and collaboration on quantum cloud computing. Specifically, we identify different types, information flows and relevant user functionalities of quantum cloud computing, based on their counterparts in classical cloud computing. Combined, this gives an overview of quantum cloud computing for the best user experience, paving the way towards user-centric quantum cloud computing.},

	abstract = {As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain. Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters.},

And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendorend as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion “shots” or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.},

In this paper we present a hybrid, cloud-based reference architecture that lowers the entry barrier to start new experiments with a wide range of quantum compute resources. The solution facilitates the execution of distributed quantum computing simulations in traditional cloud environments, and also access to several remote quantum compute resources. The reference architecture is highly portable to various cloud platforms, resulting in efficient adaptation and application possibilities by research communities.

	abstract = {Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing.},

	abstract = {The four fundamental quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement and tunneling are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with classical computers. Quantum computing relies on various types of processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them. Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum computing software projects have significantly increased in areaswhere complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems, quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy, security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM's existing Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach with advanced quantum cloud services. This paper presents a new approach to develop a sophisticated quantum ecosystem to enhance the user base and quantum computing applications.},

With the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum computing.

For example, the IBM Q Experience provides the direct access to their quantum simulators and quantum computing hardware platforms. However these current access options may not be an optimal environment for developers needing to download and modify the source codes and libraries. This paper focuses on the construction of a Docker container environment with Qiskit source codes and libraries running on a local cloud computing system that can directly access the IBM Q Experience. This prototype container based system allows single user and small project groups to do rapid prototype development, testing and implementation of extreme capability algorithms with more agility and flexibility than can be provided through the IBM Q Experience website. This prototype environment also provides an excellent teaching environment for labs and project assignments within graduate courses in cloud computing and quantum computing. The paper also discusses computer security challenges for expanding this prototype container system to larger groups of quantum computing researchers.},

To the point that it is already generating interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently, quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have already built functional quantum computers, and developed several programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway.},

Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work.},

	abstract = {At present the scale of true universal quantum computer is still small. The quantum computer has not yet been introduced into practical applications from laboratory. Therefore, quantum simulation has become the main assistant method of verifying quantum algorithms. Grover's quantum search algorithm can speed up many classical algorithms that use search heuristics. In this work, a high performance Grover algorithm simulation is proposed combining the characteristics of Grover's algorithm and the parallelism of cloud computing, which dramatically improves the performance of the load balancing among multi-core, the utilization of memory space and the efficiency of simulation. Moreover, We propose five different computing configurations in the cloud environment suitable for quantum simulation and compare them through experimentation. We also validate the effectiveness of optimization by analysis and experimentation. The experimentation shows the simulation can reach 31 bits depending on the scale of current configuration.},

These HQC algorithms help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources.},

However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway-an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time. As proof of concept, we provide an implementation of the Quantum API Gateway for the Amazon Braket platform.},

But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which Would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule ally future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model fin Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

One of the great technical challenges tomaking viable quantum computers is their qubit fidelity (quality/reliability) together with a plethora of error correction techniques-which, obviously, link to reliability theory. Hammock networks (a device-level alternative to gate-level reliability schemes) have shown outstanding reliability enhancements in the classical digital domain (e.g., about two-orders of magnitude better than gate-level von Neumann multiplexing). In spite of such performances, device-level reliability schemes in general, and hammock networks in particular, have never been assessed for quantum computations. A likely explanation is that device-level reliability seems much more akin to topological quantum computing concepts. That is why we have decided to test if and how much hammock networks might help in the quantum realm. Instead of theoretical analyses we have decided to perform simulations on IBM Q (unfortunately still gate-level constrained), and we report our preliminary findings in this paper.},

As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of approximate to 40\%. To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of approximate to 30\%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of approximate to 45\%.},

These devices allow quantum researchers and practitioners to design, develop and test quantum algorithms on actual hardware, paving the way toward new approaches in solving problems intractable by classical computers. However, in spite of these achievements in quantum technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ devices. As a consequence, there is a strong need of introducing innovative computing architectures able to interconnect a set of NISQ devices to increase the capabilities of current quantum computers of solving hard problems in a reliable way. In this paper, the concept of Distributed Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (D-NISQ) is introduced as a reference computational model by which designing innovative frameworks where quantum devices interact to solve a complex problem by working cooperatively. In detail, the D-NISQ model consists of a hybrid and hierarchical architecture where classical and quantum processors interact to iteratively split up a problem into a collection of sub-problems, solve each one of them by means of a proper quantum algorithm, and fuse output quantum information so as to compute the final solution to the problem posed. As demonstrated by two case studies based on the well-known Grover's algorithm, a multi-threaded implementation of the D-NISQ reference model allows for greater reliability in solving problems by quantum computation.},

	abstract = {In the dynamic field of quantum computing, characterized by constant innovation and continuous advancement of hardware and software capabilities, it is clear that this emerging technology holds immense potential in fields such as medicine and security. However, as the quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers. In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance, and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6\% when the load balancer is employed.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing has started to demonstrate its first practical applications. As the technology develops to a point of maturity that allows quantum computers to expand commercially, large companies such as Google, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon are making a considerably effort to make them accessible through the cloud so that research and industry initiatives can test their capabilities. The characteristics of this paradigm and the lack of mature tools still make the process of defining, implementing, and running quantum, or hybrid classical-quantum software systems difficult compared with the procedures used for pure classical ones. To address this lack, we present a demonstration of a method for defining quantum services and the automatic generation of the corresponding source code through an extension of the Open API Specification. In this demo we present an extension that enables developers to define quantum services with a high abstraction level, link them with quantum circuits, and generate the source code of the service to be deployed in a quantum computer in the same way they do for classical services.},

	abstract = {For a specific quantum chip, multi-programming improves overall throughput and resource utilization. Previous studies on mapping multiple programs often lead to resource under-utilization, high error rate, and low fidelity. This paper proposes QuCloud, a new approach for mapping quantum programs in the cloud environment. We have three new designs in QuCloud. (1) We leverage the community detection technique to partition physical qubits among concurrent quantum programs, avoiding the waste of robust resources. (2) We design X-SWAP scheme that enables inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated with critical gates to reduce the SWAP overheads. (3) We propose a compilation task scheduler that schedules concurrent quantum programs to be compiled and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. We evaluate our work on publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated quantum chip IBMQ50. Our work outperforms the state-of-the-art work for multi-programming on fidelity and compilation overheads by 9.7\% and 11.6\%, respectively.},

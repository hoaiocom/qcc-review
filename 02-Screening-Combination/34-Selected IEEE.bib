	abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs.},

While transferring the data, some issues in the cloud environment are the lack of connectivity, control, and the insecurity of the password and the data. To handle this problem, data security and the internet connection have to be enabled for the cloud environments. The method of homomorphic encryption and the transport layer security protocol have been enabled for the analysis. The homomorphic encryption method converts the data to the ciphertext for making the text in the original format. Then the transport layer security protocol is used to authenticate the data, and the data integrity of the communication can be executed. The proposed system performs better than current protocols like Dynamic Level Based Integrity Checking Protocol, TLS protocol, and Lightweight Cryptosystem, making it a potential option for jobs involving safe and effective cloud information processing. Overall, the proposed Two-tier Homomorphic Encryption system exhibits improved execution time, security strength, resource utilization, communication overhead, and user satisfaction. It addresses issues such as connectivity gaps, control deficiencies, and password and data insecurity, making it an effective method for boosting cloud security in quantum cloud computing environments.},

	abstract = {As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion “shots” or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.},

	abstract = {The popularity of cloud computing platforms has risen dramatically in recent years. As cloud computing serves millions of users at the same time, it must be able to handle all those users' demands efficiently. Thus, choosing a suitable scheduling algorithm is crucial in the cloud computing environment in order to ensure efficient performance with a reasonable degree of quality of service (QoS). The primary goal of this research is to empirically implement and evaluate a recently proposed Round-Robin algorithm with smart time quantum (RR-STQ) in a cloud computing environment, as well as, to enhance the RR-STQ with a dynamic smart time quantum. The CloudSim tool was used to simulate the cloud computing platform to implement RR-STQ and evaluate it with several algorithms using different scenarios. In addition, three scheduling performance metrics were used in the evaluation process. In all comparison scenarios, the (RR-STQ) achieved a significant improvement rate in terms of average response time (RT). Moreover, (RR-STQ) has a better performance in the average turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), and response time (RT) than the traditional RR algorithm. Also, the implemented algorithm (RR-STQ) with dynamic time quantum has a better performance than static time quantum. Based on the evaluation results, it is beneficial to integrate the RR algorithm with other scheduling models such as shortest job first (SJF) to enhance the WT and TAT. Furthermore, the investigations revealed that the dynamic time quantum improves the performance of the RR algorithm.},

Traditional heuristic approaches fall short in adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of quantum computing. This paper proposes DRLQ, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)- based technique for task placement in quantum cloud computing environments, addressing the optimization of task completion time and quantum task scheduling efficiency. It leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture, enhanced with the Rainbow DQN approach, to create a dynamic task placement strategy. This approach is one of the first in the field of quantum cloud resource management, enabling adaptive learning and decision-making for quantum cloud environments and effectively optimizing task placement based on changing conditions and resource availability. We conduct extensive experiments using the QSimPy simulation toolkit to evaluate the performance of our method, demonstrating substantial improvements in task execution efficiency and a reduction in the need to reschedule quantum tasks. Our results show that utilizing the DRLQ approach for task placement can significantly reduce total quantum task completion time by 37.81 \% to 72.93\% and prevent task rescheduling attempts compared to other heuristic approaches.},

Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a promising paradigm to solve computationally intractable problems. Various companies such as, IBM, Rigetti and D-Wave offer quantum computers using a cloud-based platform that possess several interesting features namely, (i) quantum hardware with various number of qubits and coupling maps exist at the cloud end that offer different computing capabilities; (ii) multiple hardware with identical coupling maps exist in the suite; (iii) coupling map of larger hardware with more number of qubits can fit the coupling map of many smaller hardware; (iv) the quality of each of the hardware is distinct; (v) user cannot validate the origination of the result obtained from a quantum hardware. In other words, the user relies on the scheduler of the cloud provider to allocate the requested hardware; (vi) the queue of quantum programs at the cloud end is typically long and maximizing the throughput, which is the key to reducing costs and helping the scientific community in their explorations. The above factors motivate a new threat model with following possibilities: (a) in future, less-trustworthy quantum computers from 3rd parties can allocate poor quality hardware to save on cost or towards satisfying their falsely-advertised qubit or quantum hardware specifications; (b) the workload scheduling algorithm could have a bug or malicious code segment which will try to maximize throughput at the cost of allocation to poor fidelity hardware. Such bugs are possible for trustworthy providers; (c) a rogue employee in trusted cloud vendor could try to sabotage the vendor's reputation by degrading the user compute fidelity just by tampering with the scheduling algorithm or rerouting the program; (d) a rogue employee can steal information by redirecting the programs to a 3rd party quantum hardware where they have full control. If the allocated hardware is inferior in quality, the user will suffer from poor quality result or longer convergence time. We propose two flavors of a Quantum Physically Unclonable Function (QuPUF) to address this issue- one based on superposition and another based on decoherence. Our experiments on real quantum hardware reveal that temporal variations in qubit quality can degrade the quality of the proposed QuPUF. We add a parametric rotation to the QuPUF for stability. Experiments on real IBM quantum hardware show that the proposed QuPUF can achieve inter-die Hamming Distance (HD) of 55\% and intra-HD as low as 4\%, as compared to ideal cases of 50\% and 0\% respectively. The proposed QuPUFs can also be used as a standalone solution for any other application.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this "quantum advantage", a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept.},

In contrast, IBM’s Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away.

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, the emergence of cloud-based quantum services has opened up access to this cutting-edge technology for a broader user base. As demand for these services grows, the efficient and timely delivery of quantum computing capabilities becomes increasingly critical. However, current queuing methods for executing quantum tasks on specific machines often lead to inefficient resource usage and longer waiting times. In this paper, we present Moirai, a quantum serverless function orchestration framework to reduce the maximum completion time and improve device utilization. Leveraging the unique properties of quantum circuits, Moirai introduces a customized circuit representation scheme, incorporating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) conversion and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embedding vector feature extraction. Central to Moirai is the use of reinforcement learning, which drives a suite of decision pipelines for device allocation and circuit deployment strategy. We conduct extensive evaluations involving 95 prevalent quantum algorithm circuits across 3∼7 qubits, utilizing 10 IBM quantum physical devices with three types of chip topologies. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances resource allocation efficiency and overall performance, achieving a noteworthy reduction in execution time of over 30\% compared to baseline methods. This underscores the effect of Moirai as a practical solution for optimizing quantum cloud services and unlocking the potential of quantum computing technology.},

	abstract = {What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers, just within a decade? But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

Conventional PRNGs is deterministically which makes them predicted. This type of weakness is present in them. Unlike conventional algorithms, QRNG uses something very fundamental, quantum physics. It has allowed for a breakthrough in using random numbers that are unpredictable. The main goal of the project to design a system including the QRNG (quantum random number generator) and cloud platform developed by IBM. The system produces robust and ideal output for cryptography while being both effective and efficient. We will conduct detailed and effective tuning and testing so as to increase output. Outputs of this project are a QRNG system built on the cloud that can be connected with cryptographic applications, certified sequence, and informational materials of the organization. With this research of QRNGs synchronized with the IBM cloud platform, we make cryptographic security stronger by using the quantum mechanical method to create truly random numbers. Moreover, QRNGs contribute to the cryptographic applications which are intended to be incredibly secure and of high dependability by providing random numbers to enter the realm of crypto-with very little human participation. Basically, the cloud-based architecture enable systems to scale and possible failure resilience via migrating the workload or storing the data online. Quantum improvements will speed up the process of replacing the currently accepted cryptographic paradigm with something opening new ways of digital communication. This research is about quantum physics, cloud computing, and cryptography, bringing together how these concepts operate, as a result, of the unexpected and secure cryptographic applications.},

And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based on execution time estimations.Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by over 40\% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers.},

However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92\%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services.

However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway—an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time.

	abstract = {Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is 39\% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7\% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4\% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios.},

In this study, publicly free quantum backends in the IBM quantum experience environment are discussed. The study includes a comparative explanation of the factors affecting the performance of quantum computers. Quantum circuits were created in the IBM Composer environment and then run on the appropriate backend. Quantum circuits of 4mod5, which finds whether a 4-bit number is divisible by 5, 1-bitadder that performs 1-bit addition with the carry bit, and gray code, which finds the gray code equivalent of the binary number, were created. The created circuits were run on 8 different IBMQ backends and the results were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that while the simplicity of the gates used increases the performance rates, there may be different backends that operate each quantum circuit more accurately.

Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.},

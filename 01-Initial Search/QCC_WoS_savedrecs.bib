Abstract = {Quantum computing is a rapidly progressing field: quantum computers are
   becoming more powerful and an increasing number of functionalities are
   offered via various quantum platforms and quantum software packages.
   Current quantum computers can be used almost exclusively via cloud
   services. It is expected that this will remain the case, at least in the
   near-term future. For successful adoption of quantum computing by the
   market, quantum cloud services should be user-centric. To that end, we
   explore quantum cloud computing from a user perspective. We describe a
   standardised overview of quantum cloud computing as a whole to create a
   common language to strengthen research and collaboration on quantum
   cloud computing. Specifically, we identify different types, information
   flows and relevant user functionalities of quantum cloud computing,
   based on their counterparts in classical cloud computing. Combined, this
   gives an overview of quantum cloud computing for the best user
   experience, paving the way towards user-centric quantum cloud computing.},

Abstract = {A cloud quantum computer is a quantum computer that can be accessed in a
   cloud environment through a network. Today, there are numbers of cloud
   quantum computing services that can be accessed by users. They are used
   to solve complex problems that require powerful computing. Different
   cloud quantum computing services deliver different architecture and
   performances. In our study, we conducted a research on some services to
   test and evaluate the performances of different cloud quantum computing
   services and make a comparison out of it. The test will be conducted
   using two different methods such as visual programming and qiskit From
   the result, we can see that the amount of qubit per backend and shots
   per run pretty much affect the execution time of a cloud quantum
   computing. This test will give the users some insight and enables them
   to decide which cloud quantum computing services deliver better
   performance or faster execution time based on the specification each
   cloud quantum computer offers. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by

Title = {A Novel Scheduling Framework for Multi-Programming Quantum Computing in
   Cloud Environment},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity
   of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain.
   Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum
   computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users
   from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing
   service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework
   for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage
   demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling
   framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework
   addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud
   environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces
   three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks
   to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by
   considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the
   user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across
   different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the
   quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our
   proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than
   two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and
   user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in quantum-enhanced security have demonstrated
   encouraging promise for enhancing cloud computing environments'
   security. Utilizing quantum physics, in particular Quantum Key
   Distribution (QKD), provides a new method for generating cryptographic
   keys and improves cloud data transport security. The present study
   offers a thorough investigation of the integration of QKD with
   conventional encryption techniques, including Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES), in order to tackle the dynamic cyber security scenario
   in cloud computing. The approach entails combining AES for encryption
   and decryption procedures and establishing a QKD layer within the cloud
   architecture to produce true quantum keys utilizing Quantum in Cloud
   technology. Data transmission security is greatly improved by the smooth
   integration of AES with QKD-generated keys, guaranteeing
   confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. In addition, strong key
   management practices are put in place to handle cryptographic keys
   safely at every stage of their lifespan, reducing the possibility of
   unwanted access or interception. The suggested approach successfully
   addresses the difficulties presented by cyber threats by offering a
   robust and flexible means of enhancing security in cloud-based systems.
   Using both traditional and quantum encryption methods, this strategy
   provides a strong barrier against cyber-attacks, data leaks, and other
   security flaws. After 70 simulation rounds, the suggested strategy,
   which is implemented using the QKD-AES framework in Python software,
   achieved a data access rate of 820 MB/s. In addition to providing an
   accurate and quantitative assessment of the performance, this also
   exhibits a high data access rate attained under simulated conditions. At
   15 milliseconds, the key generation time was achieved with efficiency,
   guaranteeing the quick creation of secure cryptographic keys in cloud
   environments. Overall, there is a lot of potential in using
   quantum-enhanced security techniques to protect sensitive data and
   guarantee the integrity of cloud computing infrastructures.},

Abstract = {Data security in the cloud has been a major issue since the inception
   and adoption of cloud computing. Various frameworks have been proposed,
   and yet data breach prevails. With encryption being the dominant method
   of cloud data security, the advent of quantum computing implies an
   urgent need to proffer a model that will provide adequate data security
   for both classical and quantum computing. Thus, most cryptosystems will
   be rendered susceptible and obsolete, though some cryptosystems will
   stand the test of quantum computing. The article proposes a model that
   comprises the application of a variant of McEliece cryptosystem, which
   has been tipped to replace Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) in the quantum
   computing era to secure access control data and the application of a
   variant of N-th degree truncated polynomial ring units (NTRU)
   cryptosystem to secure cloud user data. The simulation of the proposed
   McEliece algorithm showed that the algorithm has a better time
   complexity than the existing McEliece cryptosystem. Furthermore, the
   novel tweaking of parameters S and P further improves the security of
   the proposed algorithms. More so, the simulation of the proposed NTRU
   algorithm revealed that the existing NTRU cryptosystem had a superior
   time complexity when juxtaposed with the proposed NTRU cryptosystem.},

Abstract = {As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum
   machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry
   researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands
   increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and
   execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and
   resources at both the vendorend as well as the client-end. While the
   analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the
   classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology
   like quantum computing.
   This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various
   trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on
   quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze
   characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs
   which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to
   almost 10 billion ``shots{''} or trials over 20+ quantum machines.
   Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to,
   execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud,
   circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of
   job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis
   identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud
   systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and
   contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future
   quantum cloud systems.},

   devices can become, in the next future, a viable alternative for
   executing computation that is intractable classically and (ii) they can
   be exploited to assist resource management and scheduling within the
   architecture itself. Furthermore, we describe the procedure through
   which a typical resource assignment problem, which has NP-hard
   complexity, can be transformed into a formulation that can be tackled by
   QAOA, a renowned hybrid quantum algorithm, and we present some
   preliminary results obtained for a simple instance, a knapsack problem
   where an Edge node needs to select and retrieve a set of processes from

Abstract = {The analysis and investigation of the data obtained from Direct
   Numerical (DNS) simulation of droplet dynamics in cloud turbulence is a
   complex and time-consuming task when performaed on traditional
   computers. The DNS data generally have, a high spatial resolution
   \$\textbackslash{}approx 1mm\$ and require considerable space to store.
   It is tedious to find specific features of this data, such as locating
   high and low vortex areas in cloud turbulence using machine learning
   algorithms. In this research, we employ quantum computing to examine and
   analyze cloud droplet dynamics data and present a quantum supervised
   machine learning algorithm, namely, a support vector machine (SVM) to
   segregate low and high vortex regions and investigate the droplet
   characteristics in those regions. The result show that use of quantum
   computers can accelerate the entire process, and quantum mechanics
   tools, such as quantum kernels and quantum circuits can better manage
   the complex nature of data than traditional methods.},

Title = {Quantum walks-based classification model with resistance for cloud
   computing attacks},
Journal = {EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Cloud computing is considerably investigable and adoptable in both
   industry and academia, and Software Defined Networking (SDN) has been
   applied in cloud computing. Although SDN mitigates some security issues
   in cloud computing, new security issues related to its own architecture
   are also introduced. In this paper, we propose a quantum walks-based
   classification model which is available for intrusion detection in cloud
   computing. The proposed model concentrates feature information of data
   via Principal Component Analysis, and then aggregates the concentrated
   data in the way of quantum walks by a training-free clustering
   algorithm. The clustering algorithm constructs coin transformation and
   conditional shift transformation based on transition probabilities to
   move similar data toward each other. To enhance the usability of the
   proposed model in cloud computing security, we propose a new cloud
   architecture which adds security layer in SDN to ponder the protection
   of cloud computing fundamentally, and simplify transition probabilities
   equations of clustering algorithm without affecting clustering accuracy,
   decreasing the time complexity from O(nk2) to O(nk). The experimental
   results on popular datasets (Accuracy: 99.4\% on InSDN, 95.8\% on
   NSL-KDD, 98\% on UNSW-NB15 and 96.4\% on CSE-CIC-IDS2018) revealed that
   the proposed model is effective dealing with attacks on SDN-based cloud
   computing, and is able to maintain stable and excellent attack
   identification ability under different traffic intensities.},

   Facilitating Quantum Computing Capabilities for Cloud Utilization},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {143913-143924},
Abstract = {The emerging availability of quantum compute resources fosters the
   examination of its exploitation possibilities in different scientific
   domains, like artificial intelligence, manufacturing or finance. A
   significant number of research scientists primarily rely on cloud
   computing infrastructures while conducting research, whereas access to
   real (mostly remote) quantum hardware resources requires the deployment
   and proper configuration of different software components. In this paper
   we present a hybrid, cloud-based reference architecture that lowers the
   entry barrier to start new experiments with a wide range of quantum
   compute resources. The solution facilitates the execution of distributed
   quantum computing simulations in traditional cloud environments, and
   also access to several remote quantum compute resources. The reference
   architecture is highly portable to various cloud platforms, resulting in
   efficient adaptation and application possibilities by research
   communities. The paper describes our related experiences using
   commercial cloud providers and on the federated, OpenStack-based
   research infrastructure of the Hungarian Research Network (abbreviated
   as HUN-REN).},

Abstract = {With the deeply studied of quantum computing by research fellows, the
   computational complexity and time complexity of quantum algorithms
   gradually increase. The quantum computing simulator provides an
   effective platform for the development and verification of quantum
   algorithms. However, the running time and memory overhead during
   calculation will increase exponentially with the number of qubits.
   Therefore, the difficulty of high-speed quantum computing on classical
   computers will gradually increase. At present, a single node has been
   unable to meet the resource requirements of the algorithm in the quantum
   computing process, and it is necessary to expand the memory resources in
   the multi-node computing cluster. Message passing interface has high
   performance inter-process communication capabilities, which can balance
   the data transmission between different hosts. Quantum computing tasks
   can be distributed on several servers to work together to solve the same
   problem. Therefore, this paper designs an advanced scheme of deploying
   quantum computing programs on cloud computing platform to support
   message exchanging between servers using message passing interface to
   accelerate quantum computing.},

Abstract = {Quantum processing units (QPUs) are currently exclusively available from
   cloud vendors. However, with recent advancements, hosting QPUs will soon
   be possible everywhere. Existing work has yet to draw from research in
   edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid
   applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources.
   Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the
   edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution
   approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to
   integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows
   that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum.
   Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid
   classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in
   accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the
   highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on
   classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate
   the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the
   continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we
   provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical
   partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution
   quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional
   hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods
   with QNNs is viable and promising for future work.},

Abstract = {In the model of quantum cloud computing, the server executes a
   computation on the quantum data provided by the client. In this
   scenario, it is important to reduce the amount of quantum communication
   between the client and the server. A possible approach is to transform
   the desired computation into a compressed version that acts on a smaller
   number of qubits, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between
   the client and the server. Here we propose quantum autoencoders for
   quantum gates (QAEGate) as a method for compressing quantum
   computations. We illustrate it in concrete scenarios of single-round and
   multi-round communication and validate it through numerical experiments.
   A bonus of our method is it does not reveal any information about the
   server's computation other than the information present in the output.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes an effective quantum computing method that
   integrates secure cloud access and quantum key distribution (QKD) to
   ensure secure access to cloud resources. The proposed method employs a
   quantum circuit to implement a secure cloud access protocol that
   utilizes QKD to distribute a secret key between the cloud user and the
   service provider. The secret key encrypts all parties' access requests,
   response messages, and data. The security of the proposed method is
   analyzed against various types of attacks, including intercept-resend,
   man-in-the-middle, and eavesdropping. The simulation results indicate
   that the proposed method offers significant protection against such
   attacks. It can potentially provide a secure cloud access platform for
   various applications, including sensitive data storage, healthcare data
   management, and other applications that require a high level of
   security.},

Abstract = {Fog computing represents an extension of the Cloud infrastructure, which
   allows the improvement of the performance of IoT applications. The
   problem of task scheduling represents a challenge in this type of
   environment, with the aim of how to allocate the tasks to the different
   nodes of the Fog-Cloud infrastructure, in order to minimize makespan,
   cost, response time, and energy. In this paper, we propose SQGA- an
   algorithm to improve the workflow scheduling in Fog-Cloud environment.
   This algorithm is based on the quantum genetic algorithm QGA and aims to
   improve the makespan of applications deployed in the Fog-Cloud computing
   environment. The proposed SQGA scheduling algorithm is compared to the
   classical genetic algorithm and the First Come First Served algorithm.
   The experiment results show that the proposed SQGA algorithm is more
   efficient in makespan, and adapts better to the available resources.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of cloud computing and a rapid rise in capacity
   and scale of data centres results in a significant increase in
   electricity usage, rising data centre ownership costs, and increased
   carbon footprints. One of the challenging research problems of this
   point in time is to reduce the energy consumption in cloud data centres
   which leads motivation of green cloud computing. This article presents
   an energy efficient improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) to
   provide optimal solution for NP-hard task scheduling problems in cloud
   computing. An adjustable quantum rotation gate operator with adaptively
   dynamic adjustment of the rotation angle is developed according to the
   evolutionary generations and change in fitness values in each generation
   which serves as a major operation to update the population of the
   conventional QEA. The efficiency and accuracy of proposed QEA are
   greatly improved to measure the energy efficiency, makespan and resource
   utilisation in heterogeneous CC environment. Simulation results of the
   CloudSim shows that proposed QEA is superior to traditional PSO and GA
   to solve NP-hard task scheduling problems in green CC.},

Title = {Qubernetes: Towards a unified cloud-native execution platform for hybrid
   classic-quantum computing},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {175},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary
   paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial
   application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale
   computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies
   better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks.
   Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers
   must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not
   straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model
   that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid
   classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design
   Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping
   quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an
   experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling
   and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware.
   Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform
   Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation
   tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native
   principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes
   ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be
   realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By
   validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes
   infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes
   ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing.},

Abstract = {Identity theft is the most recurrent twenty-first century cybercrime.
   Thus, authentication is of utmost significance as the number of hackers
   who seek to intrigue into legitimate user's account to obtain sensitive
   information is increasing. Identity based authentication operates to
   corroborate the identity of the user so that only the legitimate user
   gets access to the service. This paper proposes a quantum identity based
   authentication and key agreement scheme for cloud server architecture.
   Quantum cryptography based on the laws of quantum physics is a vital
   technology for securing privacy and confidentiality in the field of
   network security. A formal security analysis has been performed using
   AVISPA tool that confirms the security of the proposed scheme. The
   security analysis of the proposed protocol proves that it is robust
   against all security attacks. To confirm applicability of quantum key
   distribution in cloud computing, a practical long-distance
   entanglement-based QKD experiment has been proposed. This experiment
   confirms successful generation of shifted keys over distance of 100 km
   of optical fiber with a key rate of 4.11 bit/s and an error rate of 9.21
   \%.},

Abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing plays a vital role in IT industries.
   Cloud computing is the sum of software as a service (SaaS) and utility
   computing (hardware). Elliptic Curve Cryptography provides more
   efficient performance and security for a cloud environment. The usage of
   Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) has escrow and revocation problems.
   These problems make a burden on the cloud and create access failure to
   the cloud users. Therefore, we use a novel signcryption technique Zheng
   (1997) to recover the escrow and revocation problems from the
   cloud/edge. We proposed ``A Quantum Signcryption Scheme (QuSigS) to
   Recover Key Escrow Problem (KEP) (Niu et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2015,
   Chen and Ma 2014) and Key Revocation Problem (KRP) (Al-Dahhan et al.
   Sens Multidiscipl Digit Publish Inst 19(7):1-22 2019, Li et al. IEEE
   Access 8:176738-176749 2020) in cloud computing{''}. Our proposed QuSigS
   scheme reduced communication and computational overheads, memory
   storage, and execution time, at the user side and at the server side.

   Rank Metric Codes for Cloud Computing},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {99990-100000},
Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption is a valuable technique for ensuring data
   privacy and confidentiality in the realm of cloud computing. Using this
   cryptographic primitive, the data owner can securely store and share
   data within the cloud environment. On the other hand, in recent years,
   extensive advances have been made in quantum processors, which have
   raised hopes of solving certain mathematical problems includes factoring
   integers and computing discrete logarithms of large numbers. The advent
   of quantum computers has posed a significant security threat to existing
   cryptographic protocols. The existing post-quantum attribute-based
   encryption schemes have not satisfied the essential features such as
   verifiability, user privacy and user revocability, simultaneously. In
   this paper, we present the first secure, practical and post-quantum
   attribute-based encryption scheme based on rank metric codes. Our scheme
   enjoys all mentioned features due to utilization of low rank parity
   check codes. The proposed scheme provides security against chosen
   plaintext attacks in the standard model, as well as resistance against
   reaction attacks as a kind of chosen ciphertext attacks. Moreover, at
   the 256-bit security level, the key size is about 16.5 KB, with an
   execution time of around 31.2 ms on a desktop. Our implementation
   results confirm that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the
   existing post-quantum and classical schemes.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Accurate early identification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases
   can prevent heart failure problems and reduce mortality rates. This
   study aims to use quantum learning to predict heart problems to increase
   the accuracy of traditional prediction and classification methods.
   Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques need quantum
   learning to quickly and accurately analyze massive volumes of complex
   data. With quantum computing, the suggested DL and ML algorithms can
   change their predictions on the basis of changes in the dataset. This
   approach could help with the early and accurate detection of chronic
   diseases. The Cleveland heart disease dataset is undergoing preliminary
   processing to validate missing values to increase the precision rate and
   prevent incorrect forecasts. This study examined the feasibility of
   employing and deploying a quantum ML (QML) framework via cloud computing
   to categorize cardiac conditions. The research was divided into four
   sections. First, the principal component analysis was used to preprocess
   the Cleveland dataset, recursive feature elimination was used to select
   features, and min-max normalization was used to give the dataset a
   high-dimensional value. Second, we compared traditional classifiers,
   such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network, with
   the quantum approach to verify the quantum approach's efficiency. Third,
   we examined two unique QML classification methods: quantum neural
   networks (QNNs) and quantum SVM (QSVM). Fourth, bagging-QSVM was
   developed and deployed as an ensemble learning model. Experimental
   results using the QNN show an accuracy of 77\%, a precision of 76\%, a
   recall of 73\%, and an F1 score of 75\%. With an accuracy of 85\%, a
   precision of 79\%, a recall of 90\%, and an F1-score of 84\%, the QSVM
   method demonstrated a much better performance than the QNN.
   Particularly, the Bagging\_QSVM model exhibited an outstanding
   performance, with a flawless score of 100\% across all critical
   performance measures. The study shows that the bagging method for
   ensemble learning is a solid way of increasing the accuracy of quantum
   method predictions.},

Abstract = {Scheduling in multiprocessor computing systems is experiencing prolific
   challenges in datacenters due to the alarmingly growing need for dynamic
   on-demand resource provisioning. This problem has become a challenge for
   the cloud broker due to the involvement of the numerous conflicting
   performance metrics such as minimization of makespan, energy consumption
   and load balancing, and maximization of resource utilization. These
   challenges are to be alleviated by the practical assignments of tasks
   onto VMs in a way to disperse loads among VMs with high utilization of
   resources uniformly. In this research, authors propose a
   quantum-inspired binary chaotic salp swarm algorithm for scheduling the
   tasks in multiprocessor computing systems by considering the above
   conflicting objectives. The principles of quantum computing are
   amalgamated with the BCSSA with the aim to intensify the exploration
   capability. Besides, a load balancing approach is incorporated with the
   algorithm for uniformly dispersing the loads. This algorithm considers a
   multi-objective fitness function to evaluate the fitness of the
   particles in the problem space. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm is validated and analyzed through extensive experimental
   results using the synthetic as well as the benchmark datasets in both
   homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. It is evident that the
   proposed work shows considerable improvements over Bird Swarm
   Optimization, Modified Particle Swarm Optimization, JAYA, standard SSA,
   and GAYA (a hybrid approach) with the considered objectives.},

Title = {EQGSA-DPW: A Quantum-GSA Algorithm-Based Data Placement for Scientific
   Workflow in Cloud Computing Environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The processing of scientific workflow (SW) in geo-distributed cloud
   computing holds significant importance in the placement of massive data
   between various tasks. However, data movement across storage services is
   a main concern in the geo-distributed data centers, which entails issues
   related to the cost and energy consumption of both storage services and
   network infrastructure. Aiming to optimize data placement for SW, this
   paper proposes EQGSA-DPW a novel algorithm leveraging quantum computing
   and swarm intelligence optimization to intelligently reduce costs and
   energy consumption when a SW is processed in multi-cloud. EQGSA-DPW
   considers multiple objectives (e.g., transmission bandwidth, cost and
   energy consumption of both service and communication) and improves the
   GSA algorithm by using the log-sigmoid transfer function as a
   gravitational constant G and updating agent position by quantum rotation
   angle amplitude for more diversification. Moreover, to assist EQGSA-DPW
   in finding the optima, an initial guess is proposed. The performance of
   our EQGSA-DPW algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments, which
   show that our data placement method achieves significantly better
   performance in terms of cost, energy, and data transfer than competing
   algorithms. For instance, in terms of energy consumption, EQGSA-DPW can
   on average achieve up to

Abstract = {Swarm intelligence and evolutionary algorithms (SI \& EAs) have been
   widely applied to various fields. In this paper, we make the first
   attempt, to our best knowledge, to apply an SI \& EA, Quantum Particle
   Swarm Optimization (QPSO), for addressing the task scheduling problem in
   Device-Edge-Cloud Cooperative Computing (DE3C) which is one of the most
   widespread and new computing paradigms. We first formulate the problem
   and propose a QPSO based method to solve the problem with a reasonable
   time. Then we summarize the existing variants of QPSO, which exploit
   various improvement schemes for QPSO. At last, we conduct simulated
   experiments to evaluate the performance of QPSO and its variants on
   solving the task scheduling problem of DE3C, and have the following
   findings. (1) QPSO outperforms several up-to-date heuristics and SI \&
   EAs in both the user satisfaction and the resource efficiency. (2)
   Existing improvement methods have no appreciable effect on QPSO for
   solving large-scale problems. (3) The performance of an improvement for
   QPSO depends mostly on randomness of the offset added to particle
   movements.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing has revolutionized organizational operations by
   providing convenient, on-demand access to resources. The emergence of
   the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a new paradigm for
   collaborative computing, leveraging sensors and devices that generate
   and process vast amounts of data, thereby resulting in challenges
   related to scalability and security, making the significance of
   conventional security methods even more pronounced. Consequently, in
   this paper, we propose a novel Scalable and Secure Cloud Architecture
   (SSCA) that integrates IoT and cryptographic techniques, aiming to
   develop scalable and trustworthy cloud systems, thus enabling multi-user
   systems and facilitating simultaneous access to cloud resources by
   multiple users. The design adopts a decentralized approach, utilizing
   multiple cloud nodes to handle user requests efficiently and
   incorporates Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) to ensure
   the privacy and confidentiality of user information, utilizing a hybrid
   cryptosystem that combines MBRA, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and
   blockchain technology. Leveraging IoT devices, the architecture gathers
   data from distributed sensing resources and ensures the security of
   collected information through robust MBRA-PQC encryption algorithms,
   while the blockchain ensures that the confidential data is stored in
   distributed and immutable records. The proposed approach is applied to
   several datasets and the effectiveness is validated through various
   performance metrics, including response time, throughput, scalability,
   security, and reliability. The results highlight the effectiveness of
   the proposed SSCA, showcasing a notable reduction in response time by
   1.67 seconds and 0.97 seconds for 250 and 1000 devices, respectively, in
   comparison to the MHE-IS-CPMT. Likewise, SSCA demonstrated significant
   improvements in the AUC values, exhibiting enhancements of 6.30\%,
   6.90\%, 7.60\%, and 7.30\% at the 25-user level, and impressive gains of
   5.20\%, 9.30\%, 11.50\%, and 15.40\% at the 50-user level when compared
   to the MHE-IS-CPMT, EAM, SCSS, and SHCEF models, respectively.},

Abstract = {Software as a service (SaaS) provider hires resources from an
   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provider and provides these sharable
   resources to user's applications on lease. However, it is becoming a
   more challenging issue for SaaS providers to meet user's Quality of
   Service (QoS) Parameter and maximize profit from cloud infrastructure.
   This proposed work satisfies both the user and the service provider by
   fulfilling service level agreement (SLA), user's QoS requirement, and
   increasing profit with efficient resources utilization. This paper
   proposes an Improved Quantum Salp Swarm Algorithm (IQSSA), which
   improves the Salp Swarm algorithm by incorporating the principles of
   Quantum computing to increase the convergence rate. Further,
   Quantum-inspired Salp Swarm Grey Wolf Algorithm (QSSGWA) embeds SSA with
   Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to improve the global optimum solution, and
   quantum operator is used to initializing population. Proposed algorithms
   execute tasks under the user-defined deadline and budget constraints.
   Furthermore, the penalty cost is formulated and applied in the case of a
   deadline violation. IQSSA and QSSGWA are tested on 19 global benchmark
   functions, and results prove their superior performance compared to SSA,
   GWO, BAT, and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Furthermore,
   these algorithms are simulated on CloudSim, and performance matrices
   such as service provider's profit, makespan, SLA violation rate, task
   rejection rate, throughput, resource utilization, and response time are
   compared. The comparison analysis demonstrates that the proposed
   algorithms offer better performance and more efficient scheduling than
   existing metaheuristics. Furthermore, simulation results clearly show
   that QSSGWA gives the best results for all performance matrices. This
   proposed approach can be applied in many scientific domains, where
   distributed processing of data or large scale data analysis is required
   such as distributed and federated machine learning, serverless
   computing, medical applications, etc.},

Abstract = {The four fundamental quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement
   and tunneling are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to
   solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with
   classical computers. Quantum computing relies on various types of
   processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed
   using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing
   power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over
   cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum
   computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to
   the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various
   sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them.
   Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities
   of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially
   transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum
   computing software projects have significantly increased in areaswhere
   complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From
   computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems,
   quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy,
   security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing
   Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for
   users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to
   implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to
   the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM's existing
   Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach
   with advanced quantum cloud services. This paper presents a new approach
   to develop a sophisticated quantum ecosystem to enhance the user base
   and quantum computing applications.},

Abstract = {Today's quantum computers are primarily accessible through the cloud and
   are expected to be deployed in edge networks in the near future. With
   the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research
   worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using
   cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted
   the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management
   strategies and service models for quantum computing. However, the
   limited quantity, quality, and accessibility of quantum resources pose
   significant challenges to practical research in quantum software and
   systems. To address these challenges, we propose iQuantum, a
   first-of-its-kind simulation toolkit that can model quantum computing
   environments for prototyping and evaluating system design and scheduling
   algorithms. This paper presents the quantum computing system model,
   architectural design, proof-of-concept implementation, potential use
   cases, and future development of iQuantum. Our proposed iQuantum
   simulator is anticipated to boost research in quantum software and
   systems, particularly in the creation and evaluation of policies and
   algorithms for resource management, job scheduling, and hybrid
   quantum-classical task orchestration in quantum computing environments
   integrating edge and cloud resources.},

Abstract = {At present, in the face of the huge and complex data in cloud computing,
   the parallel computing ability of quantum computing is particularly
   important. Quantum principal component analysis algorithm is used as a
   method of quantum state tomography. We perform feature extraction on the
   eigenvalue matrix of the density matrix after feature decomposition to
   achieve dimensionality reduction, proposed quantum principal component
   extraction algorithm (QPCE). Compared with the classic algorithm, this
   algorithm achieves an exponential speedup under certain conditions. The
   specific realization of the quantum circuit is given. And considering
   the limited computing power of the client, we propose a quantum
   homomorphic ciphertext dimension reduction scheme (QHEDR), the client
   can encrypt the quantum data and upload it to the cloud for computing.
   And through the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme to ensure
   security. After the calculation is completed, the client updates the key
   locally and decrypts the ciphertext result. We have implemented a
   quantum ciphertext dimensionality reduction scheme implemented in the
   quantum cloud, which does not require interaction and ensures safety. In
   addition, we have carried out experimental verification on the QPCE
   algorithm on IBM's real computing platform. Experimental results show
   that the algorithm can perform ciphertext dimension reduction safely and

Abstract = {Modern technologies like quantum and cloud computing have reshaped
   computing, offering immense power and scalability. While beneficial,
   they also challenge the security of traditional cryptographic systems.
   Quantum computing threatens RSA and ECC with algorithms like Shor's

   exposing these systems to attacks, necessitating quantum-resistant
   cryptography. Cloud computing poses data security concerns, requiring
   robust cryptographic mechanisms and access controls. Lattice-based
   cryptography, leveraging problems like the Short Integer Solution (SIS),
   emerges as a solution. This paper presents a novel quantum-resistant

   suitable for a quantum computer. Developers can now implement these
   reformulations on both quantum simulators and hardware platforms through
   a cloud computing software environment. For example, the IBM Q
   Experience provides the direct access to their quantum simulators and
   quantum computing hardware platforms. However these current access
   options may not be an optimal environment for developers needing to
   download and modify the source codes and libraries. This paper focuses
   on the construction of a Docker container environment with Qiskit source
   codes and libraries running on a local cloud computing system that can
   directly access the IBM Q Experience. This prototype container based
   system allows single user and small project groups to do rapid prototype
   development, testing and implementation of extreme capability algorithms
   with more agility and flexibility than can be provided through the IBM Q
   Experience website. This prototype environment also provides an
   excellent teaching environment for labs and project assignments within
   graduate courses in cloud computing and quantum computing. The paper
   also discusses computer security challenges for expanding this prototype
   container system to larger groups of quantum computing researchers.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing is a new paradigm for solving problems that classical
   computers cannot reach. To the point that it is already generating
   interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently,
   quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the
   execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have
   already built functional quantum computers, and developed several
   programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the
   general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered
   to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to
   the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early
   stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of
   these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum
   programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers
   are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum
   computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a
   time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the
   same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the
   communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In
   this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum
   algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can
   be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and
   invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will
   propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in
   terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web
   services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway.},

Abstract = {The vast amount of data generated by various applications necessitates
   the need for advanced computing capabilities to process, analyze and
   extract insights from it. Quantum computing, with its ability to perform
   complex operations in parallel, holds immense promise for data mining in

   quantum computing for data mining. The paper analyzes several key
   quantum algorithms, including Grover's search algorithm, quantum
   principal component analysis (QPCA), and quantum support vector machines
   (QSVM). It delves into the details of these algorithms, exploring their
   principles, applications, and potential benefits in various domains. We
   also done the comparative analysis of various algorithms and discussed
   about the difficulties of using quantum computing for data mining, such
   as the requirement for specialized knowledge, scalability issues, and

Abstract = {In recent years, as one of the new advanced manufacturing modes, cloud
   manufacturing has been received wide attentions around the world. The
   technology of cloud manufacturing intergrades the services-oriented
   techniques as well as manufacturing processes based on cloud computing.
   With the aid of the cloud computing platforms, the manufacturing
   services are provided in manufacturing clouds. However, one of the key
   challenges of cloud manufacturing is the security and safety of
   information transmission. Traditional network security architectures are
   based on RSA and elliptic curve cryptographic systems, which is claimed
   to be broken on quantum computers. We exploit the countermeasures of
   post-quantum algorithms to protect cloud manufacturing against quantum
   computer attacks. We propose a post-quantum secure scheme for cloud
   manufacturing. First, in order to retain confidentiality in cloud
   manufacturing, we propose a post-quantum asymmetric-key encryption
   scheme to encrypt the message with the generated session key. Second, in
   order to retain authentication security in cloud manufacturing, we
   propose a post-quantum public-key signature generation scheme. Third,
   based on the encryption scheme and signature generation scheme, we
   propose a post-quantum secure communication system for cloud
   manufacturing. We implement our design on cloud-based environment and
   the comparison with related designs show that our design is suitable for
   protecting communication in cloud manufacturing. Besides, the
   post-quantum secure communication system can be extended to other
   applications of intelligent manufacturing.},

Abstract = {The increasing popularity of 6G communication within the Internet of
   Vehicles (IoV) ecosystem is expected to induce a surge in both user
   numbers and data volumes. This expansion will cause substantial
   challenges in ensuring network security and privacy protection, as well
   as in addressing the associated issue of inadequate cloud computing
   resources. In this article, we propose a Quantum Efficient Privacy
   Protection (QEPP) protocol that leverages reversible information hiding
   in quantum point clouds. This protocol utilizes quantum communication
   technology in edge-to-cloud communication of the IoV to transmit
   sensitive information embedded in quantum state data, thereby ensuring
   privacy protection. It employs quantum error-correction coding and
   efficient coding techniques to extract information and recover the
   carriers. In addition, the protocol utilizes an improved quantum Grover
   algorithm in the cloud to accelerate the processing speed of quantum
   data. By addressing security vulnerabilities and improving
   cloud-computing capabilities, the QEPP can effectively accommodate
   critical requirements, including precision, timeliness, and robust
   privacy protection.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing resources are predominantly accessible through cloud
   services, with a potential future shift to edge networks. This paradigm
   and the increasing global interest in quantum computing have amplified
   the need for efficient, adaptable resource management strategies and
   service models for quantum systems. However, many limitations in the
   quantum resources' quantity, quality, availability, and cost pose
   significant challenges for conducting research in practical
   environments. To address these challenges, we proposed iQuantum, a
   holistic and lightweight discrete-event simulation toolkit uniquely
   tailored to model hybrid quantum computing environments. We also present
   a detailed system model for prototyping and problem formulation in
   quantum resource management. Through rigorous empirical validation and
   evaluations using large-scale quantum workload datasets, we demonstrate
   the flexibility and applicability of our toolkit in various use cases.
   iQuantum provides a versatile environment for designing and evaluating
   quantum resource management policies such as quantum task scheduling,
   backend selection, hybrid task offloading, and orchestration in the
   quantum cloud-edge continuum. Our work endeavors to create substantial
   contributions to quantum computing modeling and simulation, empowering
   the creation of future resource management strategies and quantum

Abstract = {Public cloud computing provides a variety of services to consumers via
   high-speed internet. The consumer can access these services anytime and
   anywhere on a balanced service cost. Many traditional authentication
   protocols are proposed to secure public cloud computing. However, the
   rapid development of high-speed internet and organizations' race to
   develop quantum computers is a nightmare for existing authentication
   schemes. These traditional authentication protocols are based on
   factorization or discrete logarithm problems. As a result, traditional
   authentication protocols are vulnerable in the quantum computing era.
   Therefore, in this article, we have proposed an authentication protocol
   based on the lattice technique for public cloud computing to resist
   quantum attacks and prevent all known tradi-tional security attacks. The
   proposed lattice-based authentication protocol is provably secure under
   the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model. At the same time, the result obtained
   during the experiments proved that our protocol is lightweight compared
   to the existing lattice-based authentication protocols, as listed in the
   performance analysis section. The comparative analysis shows that the
   protocol is suitable for practical implementation in a quantum-based
   environment.},

Abstract = {Load balancing plays an important role in cloud computing environment. A
   better load balancing algorithm provides more efficient service and
   improves cloud computing performance. In this paper, a new dynamic time
   quantum priority-based algorithm has been proposed which is suitable for
   load balancing in cloud computing environment. Round Robin is a very
   simple algorithm in cloud computing environment but the disadvantage of
   round robin algorithm is long waiting time, long response time and
   overhead for context switches. In this paper, we have proposed a new
   dynamic round robin algorithm with execution time slice which is used to
   determine dynamic time quantum (TQ) for individual service request in
   every round. Here the priority has been used to calculate the Priority
   Component (PC) of the process. Our experimental result gives the better
   performance in term of minimizing average waiting time, total number of
   context switches and average turnaround time.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing has gained attention from the scientific community and
   industry, resulting in the development of increasingly powerful quantum
   computers and supporting technology. Major computer companies have
   created functional quantum computers, programming languages, and
   simulators that can be used by developers. This infrastructure is
   available through the cloud, similar to Infrastructure as a Service.
   However, utilizing these computers requires a deep understanding of
   quantum programming and hardware, which is different from traditional
   cloud computing. To enable a coexistence between quantum and classical
   computing, we believe that a transition period is necessary. One
   solution for coexistence is through web services. This tutorial will
   provide an overview of how quantum algorithms can be converted into web
   services, and how they can be deployed using the Amazon Braket platform
   for quantum computing and invoked through classical web service
   endpoints. Finally, we will propose a process for creating and deploying
   quantum services using an extension of OpenAPI and GitHub Actions. This
   extension allows developers to use the same methodology that they are
   used to for classical services.},

Abstract = {Quantum cloud computing facilitates the rapid processing of vast amounts
   of data and provides robust network services. To enhance the efficiency
   and security of data transmission in cloud computing, this study
   proposes a quantum cloud office model and presents a novel quantum
   dialogue protocol particularly designed for this model. The proposed
   protocol enables authenticated communication among office
   correspondents. Leveraging the unique properties of multiple quantum
   degrees of freedom, this protocol expands the channel capacity and
   enhances transmission efficiency. Compared to previous
   measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocols, this
   protocol not only further improves transmission efficiency but also
   enables mutual authentication between correspondents, effectively
   defending against the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. The utilization
   of a cross-Kerr medium for Bell measurements offers a 50\% increase in
   efficiency compared to linear optical equipment. This novel protocol is
   tailored to the data transmission process within the cloud office model,
   thereby enhancing the communication efficiency and reinforcing secure
   data transmission.},

Abstract = {The 6G (the sixth generation mobile communication) network is a
   heterogeneous network, which includes the cloud computing and the fog
   computing environment. And, the data securities in the 6G Systems may
   face great challenges. On the one hand, fine-grained data access control
   in fog and cloud computing environments is essential to the 6G network.
   On the other hand, quantum computing attacks may cause great security
   threats for the 6G network. In order to solve the above problems, we
   propose a lattice-based fine-grained data access control and sharing
   scheme in fog and cloud computing environments (LB-DACSS) for the 6G
   network. Firstly, our LB-DACSS scheme can achieve secure data sharing
   and fine-grained access control in fog and cloud computing environments.
   Secondly, we apply a lattice encryption algorithm to ensure our LB-DACSS
   scheme can withstand quantum computing attacks. Thirdly, our LB-DACSS
   scheme can achieve secure attribute revocation. Fourthly, we bind a
   unique secret value related to the user's attribute to construct the
   user's secret key. Finally, both formal security analysis and
   performance analysis show that our LB-DACSS scheme is efficient and
   secure.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing resources are now becoming easily accessible from
   various cloud providers. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale
   Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute
   novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any
   other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security
   attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper
   explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to
   protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud
   provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new
   obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control
   pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum
   computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can
   enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely
   difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is
   executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic
   architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture
   that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead
   of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different
   types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work.},

Abstract = {Cloud Storage Service(CSS) provides unbounded, robust file storage
   capability and facilitates for pay-per-use and collaborative work to end
   users. But due to security issues like lack of confidentiality,
   malicious insiders, it has not gained wide spread acceptance to store
   sensitive information. Researchers have proposed proxy re-encryption
   schemes for secure data sharing through cloud. Due to advancement of
   computing technologies and advent of quantum computing algorithms,
   security of existing schemes can be compromised within seconds. Hence
   there is a need for designing security schemes which can be quantum
   computing resistant. In this paper, a secure file sharing scheme through
   cloud storage using proxy re-encryption technique has been proposed. The
   proposed scheme is proven to be chosen ciphertext secure(CCA) under
   hardness of ring-LWE, Search problem using random oracle model. The
   proposed scheme outperforms the existing CCA secure schemes in-terms of
   re-encryption time and decryption time for encrypted files which results
   in an efficient file sharing scheme through cloud storage.},

   services such as servers, storage, database, networking, software and

   extension of cloud with decentralized structure which stores the data in
   locations somewhere between the data source and cloud. The goal of fog
   computing is to provide high security, improve performance and network
   efficiency. We use quantum key distribution to produce and distribute
   key which change its quantum state and key, when key is known by
   mediator and it has ability to detect presence of mediator trying to
   gain lore of the key. In this paper, we introduced sugar-salt encryption
   which overcomes brute-force attack in effect delivers phony data in

Abstract = {Cloud services will have a high priority in IT and parts of digitisation
   in the following years. Furthermore, other areas such as medicine,
   agriculture, Industry 4.0 use cloud services for collecting, processing,
   and primarily storing data and combine this with smart IoT devices. In
   addition to high availability and ensuring efficiency without downtime,
   data security is the most important in those cloud environments.
   Therefore, enabling traffic encryption between sensors and cloud
   computing to achieve the authentication and integrity of saved data is
   expected. And established cryptographic algorithms, like the symmetric
   scheme or the asymmetric Public-Key technique Rivest-Shamir-Adleman
   (RSA), guaranteed the security of the data in the prequantum computer
   age. However, some cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable because of
   emerging quantum computing and are defined as potentially broken. It is,
   therefore, desirable to explore the use of post-quantum cryptography to
   ensure data security. This paper shows an approach to keep long-term
   data quantum-safe with a block cipher suite.},

   healthcare application scheduling with hard and soft deadline

Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Recently, the use of quantum cloud computing for different applications
   has been increasing. For instance, weather forecasting, financial
   modeling, healthcare, and automation are geographically distributed in
   practice. These applications are workflows and consist of
   compute-intensive depen-dent tasks with precedence constraints. However,
   workflow processing on quantum-based cloud services still faces issues
   in the literature regarding makespan and energy consumption. This study
   presents the Multi-objective Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (MQGA)
   to address the problems of workflow scheduling in the hybrid cloud,
   attempting to reduce makespan and energy consumption simultaneously. The
   proposed algorithm relies on the concept and principle of quantum
   mechanics, which explores the computational power of quantum computing.
   It adopted a qubit to represent the individual chromosome for better
   population diversity. It also uses a quantum rotation gate to lead the
   schedule to better convergence and avoids classical genetic operators.
   The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively
   reduce energy consumption by 23.36\% and makespan 20\% on average. (C)

Abstract = {In recent days, cloud computing is a universal computing and
   conventional paradigm, in which the resources are provided over the
   Internet based on requirements. With the huge growth of cloud storage
   and processing, security in Cloud has become the most captivating
   research domains. Though there are many methods for enhancing security
   and data confidentiality over cloud, security is the major threat among
   data owners and users in data storages and data sharing between two
   parties in Cloud. In data sharing, for assuring security, the data are
   secured with key and the key is required to be encrypted to keep that
   not accessible for attacks. With that concern, this work develops a
   Quantum Cryptography based Cloud Security Model (QC-CSM) that uses
   Quantum Key Distribution Protocol (QKDP) for sharing the secret key
   between parties. For ensuring the data owner about the security of their
   share data over Cloud, Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is used.
   Further, the data can be accessed by an authenticated user, who is
   having the access for decryption through the key from a secure quantum
   channel. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the
   existing works by providing a more secure environment and confidential
   data sharing between entities in minimal time in the Cloud framework.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing can provide a solution for many problems that
   classical communication networks encounter, but the knowledge gap
   between these two is not bridged yet. Accordingly, this paper has
   proposed directions, evaluations, and futuristic quantum solutions to
   cloud-based cellular communications. This paper shows the effect of
   using quantum entanglement phenomena upon the classical cloud network,
   particularly using an entanglement theory to decrease the enlarged
   signaling cost delay that the traditional cloud network faces. Through
   modeling the latency of both paradigms, this paper promises a delay
   reduction when adapting a quantum method into the mobile cloud networks.
   This paper also models the power consumption (PC) and energy efficiency
   of the traditional and quantum-based cloud networks. This paper also
   shows, via modeling the PC, that installing a quantum-based paradigm is
   not a power costly method; rather, it shows identical power and energy
   efficiency figures with a possibility of improvement.},

Abstract = {Scientists and researchers often need to run mid scale to large-scale
   scientific computations on powerful computing machines or platforms.
   Even with today's available powerful computing platforms, many of these
   computations still take enormous runtime. With the advent of cloud
   computing technology, scientists are now able to reduce significantly
   the computational time by outsourcing computation functions to the cloud
   systems. We show in this paper how AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud
   computing platform can be automated in executing large-scale
   computationally expensive scientific experiments. Specifically, we show
   how quantum chemistry simulations can be executed in parallel and in a
   cluster-based fashion using the publicly available and popular Amazon
   cloud platform. With Amazon cloud, we were able to reduce the
   computation time by almost five orders of magnitude. In addition, the
   paper offers many important useful guidelines, scripts, and commands for
   scientists and researchers on how to automate and execute parallel and
   cluster-based scientific jobs on any cloud platform.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing has ceased to be an exotic topic for researchers,
   moving its treatment today from theoretical physicists to computer
   scientists and engineers. Recently, several real quantum devices have
   become available through the cloud. On the other hand, different
   possibilities on-premises allow having quantum computing simulators
   using High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities. Nevertheless, they
   did not expect to be very limited, in the near term, the number and
   quality of the fundamental storage element, the qubit. Therefore,
   software quantum simulators are the only widely available tools to
   design and test quantum algorithms. However, the representation of
   quantum computing components in classical computers consumes significant
   resources. In quantum computing, a state composed of n qubits will be a
   union of all possible combinations of n 0s and 1s. That is to say, the
   size of the information is 2(n). The amplitude is the magnitude
   associated with every variety and is composed of a complex number. This
   paper shows a survey of different implementations to simulate quantum
   computing supported by classical computing, highlighting important
   considerations for implementing and developing solutions.},

Abstract = {At present the scale of true universal quantum computer is still small.
   The quantum computer has not yet been introduced into practical
   applications from laboratory. Therefore, quantum simulation has become
   the main assistant method of verifying quantum algorithms. Grover's
   quantum search algorithm can speed up many classical algorithms that use
   search heuristics. In this work, a high performance Grover algorithm
   simulation is proposed combining the characteristics of Grover's
   algorithm and the parallelism of cloud computing, which dramatically
   improves the performance of the load balancing among multi-core, the
   utilization of memory space and the efficiency of simulation. Moreover,
   We propose five different computing configurations in the cloud
   environment suitable for quantum simulation and compare them through
   experimentation. We also validate the effectiveness of optimization by
   analysis and experimentation. The experimentation shows the simulation
   can reach 31 bits depending on the scale of current configuration.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing is currently moving from an academic idea to a
   practical reality. Quantum computing in the cloud is already available
   and allows users from all over the world to develop and execute real
   quantum algorithms. However, companies which are heavily investing in
   this new technology such as Google, IBM, Rigetti, Intel, IonQ, and
   Xanadu follow diverse technological approaches. This led to a situation
   where we have substantially different quantum computing devices
   available thus far. They mostly differ in the number and kind of qubits
   and the connectivity between them. Because of that, various methods for
   realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum
   computing device are available. This paper provides an introduction and
   overview into this domain and describes corresponding methods, also
   referred to as compilers, mappers, synthesizers, transpilers, or
   routers.},

Abstract = {Simulating quantum field theories on a quantum computer is one of the
   most exciting fundamental physics applications of quantum information
   science. Dynamical time evolution of quantum fields is a challenge that
   is beyond the capabilities of classical computing, but it can teach us
   important lessons about the fundamental fabric of space and time.
   Whether we may answer scientific questions of interest using near-term
   quantum computing hardware is an open question that requires a detailed
   simulation study of quantum noise. Here we present a large scale
   simulation study powered by a multi-node implementation of qsim using
   the Google Cloud Platform. We additionally employ newly-developed GPU
   capabilities in qsim and show how Tensor Processing Units -
   Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) specialized for Machine
   Learning - may be used to dramatically speed up the simulation of large
   quantum circuits. We demonstrate the use of high performance cloud
   computing for simulating Z(2) quantum field theories on system sizes up
   to 36 qubits. We find this lattice size is not able to simulate our
   problem and observable combination with sufficient accuracy, implying
   more challenging observables of interest for this theory are likely
   beyond the reach of classical computation using exact circuit
   simulation.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is a new technology that has become a massive demand for
   computing solutions. Users can access computing resources from anywhere
   with the help of the cloud. Nowadays, more companies can hire cloud
   resources for storage and other computational purposes so that
   infrastructure costs are considered to be exceedingly reduced. The
   resource allocation mechanism based on the reservation method can be
   improved with a useful forecasting model that can provide almost well
   for developing resource allocation strategies. This can help to improve
   customer needs and the growth of businesses that are based on cloud
   computing. Service providers shall endure the cost of resources reserved
   in the cloud. Resources are allocated to reduce the associated costs.
   There are many algorithms implemented to predict the allocated resources
   in the cloud and to reduce the cost. This paper presents a Kalman filter
   with a Neuro-fuzzy system composed of an ANFIS optimized by the Quantum
   Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated with actual cluster
   tracking data in Google and demonstrated the comparison method's
   weakness by showing much improved and better predictions.},

Abstract = {Point cloud modeling is one of the most common types of 3D modeling, and
   the PointNet algorithm is an effective point cloud classification and
   segmentation algorithm. We propose the quantum accelerated PointNet
   algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses quantum computing to realize the
   three convolutional layers of the PointNet algorithm and uses classical
   computers to realize the pooling layers, the fully connected layers, and
   other parts. For a point cloud with 2(n) points and coordinate values up
   to 2(q), when performing the computation of the convolution layer of the
   PointNet algorithm with convolution kernel weights up to 2(m), our
   algorithm changes the computational complexity from O(2(n)) on an
   electronic computer to O(qm) after the quantum computing acceleration.
   The quantum accelerated PointNet algorithm proposed in this study
   changes the variables of the polynomial of computational complexity from
   2(n) to the product qm, and completely removes the effect of the
   parameter n, which is positively related to the number of points.
   Therefore, We can conclude that the quantum accelerated PointNet
   algorithm achieves a certain speedup compared to the classical PointNet
   algorithm.},

Title = {Efficient iNTRU-based public key authentication keyword searchable
   encryption in cloud computing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {154},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {With the popularity of cloud computing, a large number of personal and
   corporate data are outsourced to the cloud. This centralized storage and
   processing mode not only improves the efficiency of data processing, but
   also brings challenges to data security and privacy. In view of the
   development of quantum computing, the traditional public key encryption
   may no longer be secure in the future. Therefore, it is particularly
   important to study the public key authenticated keyword searchable
   encryption (PEAKS) scheme which can resist quantum. This scheme can
   provide double guarantee for the data in cloud storage: one is to ensure
   the confidentiality of the data, so that the original content cannot be
   decrypted even within the cloud service provider; the other is to allow
   users to perform keyword searches on encrypted data without decrypting
   the data. This provides a balance of security and efficiency for data
   search and analysis in cloud computing environment. Recently, Genise et
   al. designed a Gadget-based iNTRU trapdoor, which has the advantages of
   small size and high efficiency. Therefore, we design an efficient and
   secure public key authentication keyword searchable encryption scheme
   based on iNTRU lattice. The overall running time of this scheme is only
   more than 300ms.},

Abstract = {Computing methodologies with rapid proliferation and need for greater
   concurrency have evolved over the years from parallel and distributed
   computing to latest technologies like cloud computing. A paradigm shift
   in computing methodologies has been witnessed in the form of exponential
   speed up, optimization of problem solutions, and solvability of few
   classically unsolvable problems with emergence of quantum computing. The
   study in this article presents observations on executing basic quantum
   operations that play a vital role in quantum computing. The results and
   analysis demonstrate how parameters of time, deviation, and shots have a
   significant effect on outcomes of quantum circuits executed which can be
   a reference point for the community in general engaged in designing of
   quantum circuits, protocols, algorithms, and quantum hardware to
   leverage quantum characteristics and properties. The study by means of
   experimental use cases provides a rigorous review of qubit behavior,
   standard, and entangled qubit measurement with practical results over a
   simulator and real quantum hardware for variable qubit configurations
   using a selected platform of IBM Q Experience. With the paradigm shift
   from classical to quantum computing, this article provides basic but
   very vital observations which can be brought to use by anyone intending
   to build quantum applications.},

Abstract = {The cloud computing field suffers from the heavy processing caused by
   the exponentially increasing data traffic. Therefore, optimizing the
   network performance and achieving a better quality of service (QoS)
   became a central goal. In cloud computing, the problem of energy
   consumption of resource distribution management system (RDMS) is
   presented as an optimization problem. Most of the existing classical
   optimization approaches, such as heuristic and metaheuristic have high
   computational complexity. In this work, we proposed a quantum
   optimization strategy that executes the tasks exponentially faster and
   with high accuracy named constrained quantum optimization algorithm
   (CQOA). We exploit the CQOA in RDMS as a toy example for pointing out
   the efficiency of the proposed quantum strategy in reducing energy
   consumption and computational complexity. Following that, we investigate
   the CQOA's implementation, setup, and computational complexity. Finally,
   we create a simulation environment to evaluate the efficiency of the
   suggested implemented constrained quantum strategy.},

Abstract = {Many problems in cellular communications cannot be solved classically.
   Due to its robustness, quantum computing can enrich the classical with
   other dimensions, security and cryptic-natured. However, the awareness
   about how to fully bridge the classical and quantum communications is
   not fully realised. In other words, the quantum phenomena are not
   totally utilised within the classical dimension. This work rather
   discusses directions and evaluations for future quantum solutions to
   traditional cloud mobile networks. Particularly, using quantum
   correlation phenomena to enhance the performance of X2 application
   protocol (X2-AP) by reducing the signalling overhead regarding the delay
   and power consumption that classical cloud encounter. Through modelling
   the latency of both paradigms using `MATLAB', this work promises a delay
   reduction when adapting quantum method into the cloud. This study also
   models the power consumption and energy efficiency of traditional and
   quantum-based cloud networks. This work also shows, via modelling the
   power consumption, that installing a quantum-based paradigm is not a
   power costly method; rather, it shows identical power and energy
   efficiency figures with a possibility of improvement.},

Abstract = {The hottest topics for many researchers in the past five years were
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning. With many kinds of
   researches using machine learning, numerous AI engineers are still
   emerging. If the center of current research trends is on AI and machine
   learning, the center of near-future research trends will be on quantum
   computing techniques. The qubit implementation via superconductivity,
   diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center, ion-trap, and etc. has made
   quantum computers really exist. And cloud computing has made it possible
   for researchers around the world to use quantum computers remotely to
   their researches. The universalization of quantum computing techniques
   is no longer a story of the distant future, even more so for numerous AI
   engineers. This paper introduces some useful quantum computing

Abstract = {The increasing popularity of cloud computing systems has drawn
   significant attention from academics and businesses for several decades.
   However, cloud computing systems are plagued with several concerns, such
   as privacy, confidentiality, and availability, which can be detrimental
   to their performance. Intrusion detection has emerged as a critical
   issue, particularly in detecting new types of intrusions that can
   compromise the security of cloud systems. Preventive risk models have
   been developed to check the cloud for potential threats, and the rise of
   quantum computing attacks necessitates the deployment of an intrusion
   detection system (IDS) for cloud security risk assessment. This research
   proposes a unique method for detecting cloud computing intrusions by
   utilizing the KDDcup 1999, UNSW-NB15, and NSL-KDD datasets to address
   these concerns. This proposed system is designed to achieve two
   objectives. Firstly, it analyzes the disadvantages of existing IDS, and
   secondly, it presents an accuracy enhancement model of IDS. The proposed
   Ensemble Intrusion Detection Model for Cloud Computing Using Deep
   Learning (EICDL) is designed to detect intrusions effectively. The
   performance of the proposed model is compared to modern machine learning
   methods and existing IDS, and the experimental findings indicate that
   the EICDL ensemble technique improves detection and can identify
   subsequent attacks/intrusions with a recall rate of 92.14\%. The
   proposed method EICDL ensemble technique significantly improves the
   accuracy and efficiency of intrusion detection in cloud systems.},

Abstract = {Mobile cloud computing (MCC) initially draws on cloud and mobile
   computing principles, where it focuses on wireless networks to provide
   mobile users with rich computing services. In the modern era, the
   sharing of secured large-scale data is the major challenging task.
   However, problems continue to be resolved such that the omnipresent
   usage and use of mobile cloud computing are feasible. Some of the
   challenges include security, lossless back-up and data recovery, and
   computational complexity. To deal with this scenario, a unique
   combination of the trefoil congruity framework is proposed to secure a
   privacy-preserving user consent solution by using the backup method to
   store and recover a huge amount of data. Quantum key fibo privacy
   approach (QKFPA) encrypts and decrypts the data using the fibonacci
   chain-leaning matrix along with quantum computation to provide security
   while transmitting/unloading user information. Consecutively,
   high-security distribution and rake technology (HSDRT) is enhanced to
   block the inside attackers and ensures retrieval of saved data without
   any loss. Once the storage is enhanced, data access is highly secured
   through the emperor-imperial technique, which generates an imperial
   label between mobile users and cloud server through the selection of
   emperor node. The outcome of the work offers great fortification for
   cyber threats, authentication, and lossless retrieval of data in MCCs.},

Abstract = {Autonomic computing investigates how systems can achieve (user)
   specified ``control{''} outcomes on their own, without the intervention
   of a human operator. Autonomic computing fundamentals have been
   substantially influenced by those of control theory for closed and
   open-loop systems. In practice, complex systems may exhibit a number of
   concurrent and inter-dependent control loops. Despite research into
   autonomic models for managing computer resources, ranging from
   individual resources (e.g., web servers) to a resource ensemble (e.g.,
   multiple resources within a data centre), research into integrating
   Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to improve
   resource autonomy and performance at scale continues to be a fundamental
   challenge. The integration of AI/ML to achieve such autonomic and
   self-management of systems can be achieved at different levels of
   granularity, from full to human-in-the-loop automation. In this article,
   leading academics, researchers, practitioners, engineers, and scientists
   in the fields of cloud computing, AI/ML, and quantum computing join to
   discuss current research and potential future directions for these
   fields. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities for leveraging
   AI and ML in next generation computing for emerging computing paradigms,
   including cloud, fog, edge, serverless and quantum computing
   environments.},

Title = {Enhanced Round-Robin Algorithm in the Cloud Computing Environment for
   Optimal Task Scheduling},
Journal = {COMPUTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Recently, there has been significant growth in the popularity of cloud
   computing systems. One of the main issues in building cloud computing
   systems is task scheduling. It plays a critical role in achieving
   high-level performance and outstanding throughput by having the greatest
   benefit from the resources. Therefore, enhancing task scheduling
   algorithms will enhance the QoS, thus leading to more sustainability of
   cloud computing systems. This paper introduces a novel technique called
   the dynamic round-robin heuristic algorithm (DRRHA) by utilizing the
   round-robin algorithm and tuning its time quantum in a dynamic manner
   based on the mean of the time quantum. Moreover, we applied the
   remaining burst time of the task as a factor to decide the continuity of
   executing the task during the current round. The experimental results
   obtained using the CloudSim Plus tool showed that the DRRHA
   significantly outperformed the competition in terms of the average
   waiting time, turnaround time, and response time compared with several
   studied algorithms, including IRRVQ, dynamic time slice round-robin,
   improved RR, and SRDQ algorithms.},

Abstract = {Security and privacy are issues that cannot be ignored when collecting
   and processing medical data in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT).
   The blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that has
   diverse application scenarios in the medical field. The blockchain
   technology relies on traditional cryptography to ensure data integrity
   and verifiability, but the creation of quantum computing has made it
   possible to break traditional encryption and signature methods.
   Therefore, quantum blockchain can provide a higher level of security for
   handling medical data. This article innovatively designs a new medical
   data processing system based on quantum blockchain (QB-IMD). In QB-IMD,
   a quantum blockchain structure and a novel electronic medical record
   algorithm (QEMR) are proposed to ensure that the processed data is
   legitimate and tamper-proof. QEMR combines quantum signature and quantum
   identity authentication to avoid the potential security risks of digital
   signatures. In addition, through delegated computing by quantum cloud,
   medical diagnostic data can be computed without leaking to quantum cloud
   servers, thus protecting user privacy. Through mathematical proof,
   theoretical analysis, and simulation, it is demonstrated that our scheme
   can resist six attacks and is feasible to protect user privacy.},

Abstract = {data driven smart applications, utilize the IoT, Cloud Computing, AI and
   other digital technologies to create, curate and operate on large
   amounts of data to provide intelligent solutions for day-to-day
   problems. Security of Data in the IoT-Cloud systems has become very
   crucial as there are several attacks such as ransomware, data thieving,
   and data corruption, causing huge loss to the application users. The
   basic impediment in providing strong security solutions for the IoT
   systems, is due the resource limitations of IoT devices. Recently, there
   is an additional threat of quantum computing being able to break the
   traditional cryptographic techniques. The objective of this research is
   to address the bifold challenge and design a light weight quantum secure
   communication protocol for the IoT Cloud ecosystem. The Ring Learning
   With Errors (RLWE) lattice based cryptography has emerged as the most
   popular in the NIST PQC Standardization Program. A light weight Circular
   Learning Error Algorithm (CELA) has been proposed by optimizing RLWE to
   make it suitable for IoT-Cloud environment. The CELA inherits the
   advantages of quantum security and homomorphic encryption from RLWE. It
   is observed that CELA is light weight in terms of execution time and a
   slightly bigger cipher text size provides higher security as compared to
   RLWE. The paper also offers plausible solutions for future quantum
   secure cryptographic protocols.},

Abstract = {Each day more and more data is produced by different sources including
   humans and machines, and they are stored mainly in Cloud Service
   Providers (CSP) in huge data storages known as big data or data lakes.
   Many situations warrant users to spread their data in a distributed way
   between the different CSP. When this happens, they have to relay the
   inter-cloud communication security to each cloud vendor. This can cause
   data leakage in the transmission channel thereby compromise information
   security. Quantum computing has shown some promises to address this
   issue. One well known algorithm in quantum cryptography is the Quantum
   Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of
   a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the
   insecure quantum channel. There are studies integrating this QKD
   protocol with cloud storage and data transmission inside one CSP.
   However, there is no research that studies the data lake security
   concern for distributed multi-cloud communications taking advantage of
   quantum mechanisms. This research proposal aims to address this gap in
   distributed data lake security by using the QKD protocol in the
   multi-cloud distributed data transmission. The achieved results show
   over 91\% detection of eavesdropping cases and over 99\% correct
   authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments.},

Abstract = {As the demand for high-performance and dynamically adaptable network
   services continues to grow, the convergence of quantum computing and
   network orchestration represents a promising development. This paper
   explores the transformative potential of quantum computing in the
   orchestration of network services and introduces new paradigms that
   transcend classical limitations. Using a case study, we propose a
   workflow for an exemplary link failure process for generative AI (GenAI)
   and quantum computing-based service orchestration in an edge cloud (EC)
   network. Later, we address the challenges of integrating services based
   on quantum computing (using a quantum search algorithm to select the
   best connections) with GenAI-based topology control and management in an
   orchestration framework. Our work also introduces multi-solution quantum
   search for orchestrating services across different edge clouds,
   emphasizing efficiency and accuracy. Algorithmic considerations,
   including the impact of the oracle and hybrid approaches, are also
   thoroughly explored. We conclude the paper with potentials and
   comparisons of possible GenAI techniques and quantum search algorithms
   in terms of their advantages and disadvantages.},

Title = {IsoqurPEKS: An Isogeny-Based Quantum-Resistant Public-Key Encryption
   Scheme with Keyword Search},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Since the convenience and advancement of cloud applications, many users
   (e.g., companies or individuals) adopt remote cloud services to reduce
   the local storage overload and computing consumption. However, before
   transferring them to the cloud server, users always encrypt outsourced
   data for the privacy of important data, which deprives flexible usage of
   these data. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) undoubtedly
   offers a precise resolution to this issue. Unfortunately, most PEKS
   schemes cannot fight against quantum computing attackers, which is
   increasingly a research hotspot. To achieve postquantum security and
   privacy-preserving search function, we propose a quantum-resistant PEKS
   scheme named IsoqurPEKS. Our proposed instantiation satisfies basic
   semantic security indistinguishable against chosen keyword attack
   (IND-CKA), and IsoqurPEKS is proved to be secure under the security
   model. Furthermore, we compare IsoqurPEKS with the other eight current
   PEKS schemes with respect to security properties, communication, and
   computation costs. The comparison results indicate that the proposed
   scheme has the best security and performance among the nine PEKS
   schemes.},

Abstract = {Early quantum computers are being offered by Cloud providers, with the
   ability to run Hybrid Quantum-Classical (HQC) applications that span
   Quantum and Classical (binary) computing resources. These HQC algorithms
   help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum
   hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a
   remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent
   Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized
   access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within
   their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In
   contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the
   classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we
   study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum
   Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an
   equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the
   latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers
   insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum
   applications across such hybrid resources.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING},

Abstract = {Cloud computing technologies rely on powerful storage services and
   computing capabilities to maintain massive data for users. Since many
   cloud storage data probably contain sensitive privacy information, they
   are typically encrypted before outsourcing, which simultaneously limits
   the availability due to the difficulty of encrypted data retrieval.
   Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) contributes to
   searching target encrypted data with keywords. However, majority of
   existing PEKS mechanisms require to manage certificates in the public
   key infrastructure (PKI), they are also vulnerable to adversaries
   equipped with quantum-computing devices in the near future. In this
   article, we devise a biometric identity-based multi-keyword search
   (BIB-MKS) mechanism from lattices over encrypted outsourced data, which
   inherently resists quantum-computing attacks. Each user in BIB-MKS is
   identified with her/his biometric information, which could be envisioned
   as the public key, thereby avoiding complex certificate managements.
   Particularly, BIB-MKS enables a data owner to produce an index
   associated with a biometric identity BID', such that a user with a
   biometric identity BID issues multiple keywords in a single search query
   and retrieves corresponding encrypted data, if and only if BID and BID'
   are within a certain distance of each other as judged by some metric.
   BIB-MKS narrows down the search scope, and improves users search
   experience significantly. We define the formal security model of
   BIB-MKS, and prove the security of BIB-MKS under this model. The
   performance evaluation demonstrates that BIB-MKS is practical for
   post-quantum secure cloud storage systems.},

   tools, and outline the perspective for developing quantum programming
   tools supporting symbolic programming for the needs of quantum computing

   technologies, as they can in the most direct way benefit from developing
   tools enabling the symbolic manipulation of quantum circuits and
   providing software tools for creating, optimizing, and testing quantum
   programs. We deliver a short survey of the most popular approaches in
   the field of quantum software development, pointing their strengths and
   weaknesses. This helps to formulate a list of desirable characteristics
   which should be included in quantum computing frameworks. Next, we
   describe a software architecture and its preliminary implementation
   supporting the development of quantum programs using symbolic approach,
   encouraging the functional programming paradigm, and, at the same, time
   enabling the integration with high-performance and cloud computing. The
   described software consists of several packages developed to address
   different needs, but nevertheless sharing common design concepts. We
   also outline how the presented approach could be used in tasks in
   quantum software engineering: quantum software testing and quantum
   circuit construction.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing plays a vital task in our daily lives, in which an
   enormous amount of data is stored daily on cloud storage. The highest
   priority for cloud data storage is guaranteeing the security of
   confidential data. The security of confidential data can be realised
   through utilising one of the cryptographic mechanisms including
   encryption and data hiding. With the rapid development for the
   realization of quantum computers, modern cryptosystems may be cracked
   including cloud systems. Accordingly, it is a crucial task for achieving
   confidentiality of data stored on cloud storage before the availability
   of quantum computers. Therefore, this study aims to utilise one of the
   quantum computational models, as a quantum-inspired system, to layout a
   new data confidentiality technique that can be applied in digital
   devices to have the capability for resisting the potential attacks from
   quantum and digital computers. In this paper, a new image security
   algorithm for real-time cloud applications using Gray code, quantum
   walks (QW), and Henon map is proposed. In the proposed image
   cryptosystem, the generated key streams from QW and Henon map is related
   to the plain image with high sensitivity of slight bit changes on the
   plain image. The outcomes based on deep analysis proves that the
   presented algorithm is efficient with high security for real-time
   application.},

Abstract = {Edge computing is a computing framework that offers fewer computing
   resources compared to cloud computing but brings enterprise applications
   closer to data sources like Internet of Things (IoT) devices or local
   edge servers. This proximity to data sources brings significant business
   benefits such as faster insights, improved response time, and better
   bandwidth availability. Consequently, edge computing technologies have
   witnessed widespread adoption. Edge computing faces significant security
   challenges due to factors like limited cost, volume, and power
   consumption, as well as the potential risk of quantum computers breaking
   conventional cryptographic systems. Limitation of computing power in
   edge computing nodes further complicates the system architecture to
   achieve secure data transmission. To overcome these challenges, this
   paper proposes a lightweight trusted inference mechanism specifically
   designed for edge computing workloads. The primary objective of this
   mechanism is to establish a balance between security and bandwidth by
   incorporating a post-quantum encryption to the edge computing devices.
   This is achieved through sharing convolution and encryption hardware at
   the edge while encrypting and transmitting intermediate results of
   inference computations to the cloud, thereby minimizing resource usage
   and transmission bandwidth requirements. The FPGA platform is utilized
   to implement a template hardware design, which demonstrated comparable
   resource consumption to the state-of-art work. Simulation results
   indicate that our mechanism achieves a 45.3\% reduction in LUTs and a
   55.5\% reduction in DFFs within the hardware, while introducing only a
   marginal software slowdown of 0.39\%.},

Abstract = {With the drive to create a decentralized digital economy, Web 3.0 has
   become a cornerstone of digital transformation, developed on the basis
   of computing power networks, distributed data storage, and blockchain.
   With the rapid realization of quantum devices, Web 3.0 is being
   developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and
   quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the
   original cryptographic systems that protect data security while
   reshaping modern cryptography with the advantages of quantum computing
   and communication. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a quantum
   blockchain-driven Web 3.0 framework that provides information-theoretic
   security for decentralized data transferring and payment transactions.
   First, we present the framework of quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0
   with futureproof security during the transmission of data and
   transaction information. Next, we discuss the potential applications and
   challenges of implementing quantum blockchain in Web 3.0. Finally, we
   describe a use case for quantum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and propose a
   quantum deep learning-based optimal auction for NFT trading to maximize
   the achievable revenue for sufficient liquidity in Web 3.0. In this way,
   the proposed framework can achieve proven security and sustainability
   for the next-generation decentralized digital society.},

Abstract = {In recent years, cloud storage services have risen widely, and how to
   ensure the integrity of outsourced data in cloud setting catches more
   and more attention. Kinds of integrity auditing protocols, additionally
   attaching tags on original data file, have been proposed. In order to
   compress the storage and communication overheads, Yang et al. presented
   a compressive auditing technique, which is identity-based and quantum
   computing resistant. Note that Yang et al. also claimed that their
   protocol is ``suitable{''} for outsourcing auditing process to third
   party auditor (TPA). However, in this paper, we first pointed out that
   Yang et al.'s compressive protocol is essentially private auditing since
   the data owner needs to confidential transmit secret value to TPA. In
   fact, if TPA shares this value to cloud service provider (CSP), then
   Yang et al.'s scheme will become completely insecure. Then, we propose a
   new identity-based protocol, which is based on lattice and thus still
   secure in future quantum computing. Meanwhile, our proposed protocol
   belongs to public auditing instead of private auditing. Finally, we
   analyze the performance of our proposed protocol, which shows that it is
   competitive in the cloud storage applications.},

Abstract = {In the past decade, the evolution of computing has moved from
   distributed, parallel, grid, cloud, and now to fog computing. The
   massive amount of data generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices is
   growing up exponentially. The flood of information (generated by those
   IoT/Internet-connected devices) becomes troublesome for data processing
   and analytical prediction functionality using cloud computation. Several
   problems have been investigated with cloud computing with respect to
   latency, limited bandwidth, low Internet connectivity, etc. Here,
   solution to such problems can be solved by introducing fog computing
   with powerful functionality of cloud framework, i.e., based on the
   deployment of fog nodes called microclouds at nearest edge of data
   sources. Fog computing for big data/IoT data analytics is in evolving
   phase and requires extensive research to produce more knowledge and
   smart decisions. This article discusses several basic facts related to
   fog commuting, challenges in fog computing and opportunities in the near
   future, in the context of fog big IoT data analytics. In addition, this
   work also emphasizes the key characteristics in some proposed research
   works, those make the fog computing as a suitable (useful) platform for
   new proliferating IoT devices, services, and applications. Most
   significant fog applications (e.g. healthcare monitoring, smart cities,
   connected vehicles, and smart grid, etc.) will be discussed here to
   create a well-organized green and quantum computing paradigm to support
   the next generation of IoT applications.},

Abstract = {As quantum computers mature, the complexity of quantum software
   increases. As we move from the initial standalone quantum algorithms
   toward complex solutions combining quantum algorithms with traditional
   software, new software engineering methods and abstractions are needed.
   Nowadays, quantum computers are usually offered in the cloud, under a
   pay-per-use model, leading to the adoption of the service-oriented good
   practices that dominate the cloud today. However, specific adaptations
   are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while
   dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose
   the Quantum API Gateway-an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that
   takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as
   traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the
   best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time. As
   proof of concept, we provide an implementation of the Quantum API
   Gateway for the Amazon Braket platform.},

Abstract = {The Operations Centre of the Romanian National Grid Infrastructure
   (NGI-RO) currently provides a broad spectrum of computing resources and
   services to various non high-energy physics research communities. The
   available computing paradigms include HPC (MPI/CPU and CUDA/GPGPU), grid
   computing, and cloud - which facilitates the provision, allocation and
   delivery of resources on demand for scientific researchers. As manager
   of the only Romanian cloud centre that is certified within the European
   Infrastructure for Advanced Computing (EGI) and connected to the EGI
   Federated Cloud - which is implementing the European Open Science Cloud
   (EOSC), IFIN-HH strives for including the national research communities
   among the beneficiaries of the future EOSC infrastructure. Therefore,
   the sites managed by the Operations Centre support scientific areas of
   major interest in the national and European research strategies, such as
   the physics of intense laser - nuclear matter interaction, computational
   biology, nanomaterials technology and quantum optics devices.
   This article reviews the recent developments regarding the support
   provided through the infrastructure of the GRIDIFIN and CLOUDIFIN sites
   to the experimental groups of the Extreme Light Infrastructure - Nuclear
   Physics (ELI-NP) ESFRI, the community of computational biologists, the
   researchers in condensed matter physics and nanomaterial technology.},

Abstract = {The smart grid is considered to be the next-generation electric power
   network. In a smart grid, there are massive data to be processed, so
   cloud computing is introduced into it to form a cloud-based smart grid
   data management system. However, with data no longer being stored
   locally, how to ensure the integrity of data stored in the cloud in the
   smart grid has become an urgent problem awaiting solution. Provable data
   possession has been proposed to solve this problem. With the development
   of quantum computer technology, quantum attacks-resistant cryptographic
   schemes are gradually entering people's horizons. Lattice cryptography
   can resist quantum attacks. In this article, a lattice-based provable
   data possession scheme is proposed for cloud-based smart grid data
   management systems. The scheme is proved unforgeable under the small
   integer solution hard assumption in the standard model. Compared with
   other two efficient lattice-based provable data possession schemes in
   the standard model, our scheme also shows efficiency.},

Title = {Quantum Searchable Encryption for Cloud Data Based on Full-Blind Quantum
   Computation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {186284-186295},
Abstract = {Searchable encryption (SE) is a positive way to protect users sensitive
   data in cloud computing setting, while preserving search ability on the
   server side, i.e., it allows the server to search encrypted data without
   leaking information about the plaintext data. In this paper, a
   multi-client universal circuit-based full-blind quantum computation
   (FBQC) model is proposed. In order to meet the requirements of
   multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data, all clients
   with limited quantum ability outsource the key generation to a trusted
   key center and upload their encrypted data to the data center.
   Considering the feasibility of physical implementation, all quantum
   gates in the circuit are replaced with the combination of pi/8 rotation
   operator set \{R-z(pi/4), Ry(pi/4), CRz(pi/4), CRy(pi/4), CCRz(pi/4),
   CCRy(pi/4)\}. In addition, the data center is only allowed to perform
   one pi/8 rotation operator each time, but does not know the structure of
   the circuit (i.e., quantum computation), so it can guarantee the
   blindness of computation. Then, through combining this multi-client FBQC
   model and Grover searching algorithm, we continue to propose a quantum
   searchable encryption scheme for cloud data. It solves the problem of
   multi-client access mode under searchable encryption in the cloud
   environment, and has the ability to resist against some quantum attacks.
   To better demonstrate our scheme, an example of our scheme to search on
   encrypted 2-qubit state is given in detail. Furthermore, the security of
   our scheme is analysed from two aspects: external attacks and internal
   attacks, and the result indicates that it can resist against such kinds
   of attacks and also guarantee the blindness of data and computation.},

Abstract = {The rapidly growing interest in quantum computing also increases the
   importance of securing these computers from various physical attacks.
   Constantly increasing qubit counts and improvements to the fidelity of
   the quantum computers hold great promise for the ability of these
   computers to run novel algorithms with highly sensitive intellectual
   property. However, in today's cloud-based quantum computer setting,
   users lack physical control over the computers. Physical attacks, such
   as those perpetrated by malicious insiders in data centers, could be
   used to extract sensitive information about the circuits being executed
   on these computers. This work shows the first exploration and study of
   power-based side-channel attacks in quantum computers. The explored
   attacks could be used to recover information about the control pulses
   sent to these computers. By analyzing these control pulses, attackers
   can reverse-engineer the equivalent gate-level description of the
   circuits, and the algorithms being run, or data hard-coded into the
   circuits. This work introduces five new types of attacks, and evaluates
   them using control pulse information available from cloud-based quantum
   computers. This work demonstrates how and what circuits could be
   recovered, and then in turn how to defend from the newly demonstrated
   side-channel attacks on quantum computing systems.},

   analysis to a collection of random numbers output from a 20-qubit
   superconducting-qubit cloud quantum computer using the simplest random
   number generation scheme. The analysis indicates temporal correlation in
   the output of some sequences obtained from the 20 qubits. This temporal
   correlation may be not related to the relaxation time of each qubit.},

Abstract = {With quantum computers now available as cloud services, there is a
   global quest for applications where a quantum advantage can be shown.
   Naturally, data management is a candidate domain. Workable solutions
   require the design of hybrid quantum algorithms, where a quantum

   towards solving a problem. This demo illustrates such an end-to-end
   solution targeting NP-hard variants of database schema matching. Our
   demo is intended to be educational (and hopefully inspiring), allowing
   participants to explore the critical design decisions, such as the
   handover between phases of QPU- and CPU-based computation. It will also
   allow participants to experience hands-on - through playful interaction
   - how easily problem sizes exceed the limitations of today's QPUs.},

Abstract = {Cloud computing is a growing environment. Many of the users are
   interested to outsource their data in cloud; however, load balancing in
   cloud is still at risk. Resource allocation plays a major role in load
   balancing. In this scheduling problem, independent task in cloud
   computing can allocate resource by the summary of modified canopy fuzzy
   c-means algorithm (MCFCMA). To allocate task to their corresponding
   resource, particle swarm-based optimization algorithm (PSO) is used. In
   proposed scheme, first independent task selected based on load
   feed-back, cluster the requested task using MCFCMA and schedule task to
   each virtual machine. VM selects parallel execution in virtual machine
   manager. Calculate feature value using PSO algorithm. Allocate resource
   to the task. Since our proposed system selects resource based on
   parallel execution, it reduces load balancing in Cloud Quantum
   Computation (CQC). The proposed system overcomes issues in load
   balancing and load scheduling; this can be proved by its precision and
   privacy calculation.},

Title = {Lattice-Based Searchable Encryption Scheme against Inside Keywords
   Guessing Attack},
Journal = {CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS \& CONTINUA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {64},
Number = {2},
Pages = {1107-1125},
Abstract = {To save the local storage, users store the data on the cloud server who
   offers convenient internet services. To guarantee the data privacy,
   users encrypt the data before uploading them into the cloud server.
   Since encryption can reduce the data availability, public-key encryption
   with keyword search (PEKS) is developed to achieve the retrieval of the
   encrypted data without decrypting them. However, most PEKS schemes
   cannot resist quantum computing attack, because the corresponding
   hardness assumptions are some number theory problems that can be solved
   efficiently under quantum computers. Besides, the traditional PEKS
   schemes have an inherent security issue that they cannot resist inside
   keywords guessing attack (KGA). In this attack, a malicious server can
   guess the keywords encapsulated in the search token by computing the
   ciphertext of keywords exhaustively and performing the test between the
   token and the ciphertext of keywords. In the paper, we propose a
   lattice-based PEKS scheme that can resist quantum computing attacks. To
   resist inside KGA, this scheme adopts a lattice-based signature
   technique into the encryption of keywords to prevent the malicious
   server from forging a valid ciphertext. Finally, some simulation
   experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
   scheme and some comparison results are further shown with respect to
   other searchable schemes.},

Journal = {MACHINE LEARNING},

Abstract = {Recent advances in practical quantum computing have led to a variety of
   cloud-based quantum computing platforms that allow researchers to
   evaluate their algorithms on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. A
   common property of quantum computers is that they can exhibit instances
   of true randomness as opposed to pseudo-randomness obtained from
   classical systems. Investigating the effects of such true quantum
   randomness in the context of machine learning is appealing, and recent
   results vaguely suggest that benefits can indeed be achieved from the
   use of quantum random numbers. To shed some more light on this topic, we
   empirically study the effects of hardware-biased quantum random numbers
   on the initialization of artificial neural network weights in numerical
   experiments. We find no statistically significant difference in
   comparison with unbiased quantum random numbers as well as biased and
   unbiased random numbers from a classical pseudo-random number generator.
   The quantum random numbers for our experiments are obtained from real
   quantum hardware.},

Abstract = {What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers, just

   functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today,
   from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term
   programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the
   industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software
   development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future
   development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all
   these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new
   machine, which Would eradicate the software in place, which the industry
   had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid
   Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating
   the fundamental laws of nature which rule ally future quantum computing
   system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can
   be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of
   imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a
   generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a
   Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a
   Uniform Computing Model fin Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be
   applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing
   hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

Abstract = {Computing today requires a lot of processing power, an immersive
   environment, and excellent precision. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
   multiprocessor architecture with quantum integration for data-intensive
   applications like a metaverse. Regular non-computationally intensive
   applications are handled by the central processing unit (CPU) and video
   rendering, graphically intensive programs by the graphics processing
   unit (GPU), and enormous, parallel, and computationally intensive
   applications by the quantum processing unit (QPU). To achieve higher
   permanence computing, we provide combined CPU, GPU, and QPU architecture
   in this work. This paper provides a roadmap for truly high-performance
   computing for massive real-time systems. In addition, we present an
   onsite and cloud-based architecture for scalability. Also, we present
   multimodality security protection systems for internal and external
   communication based on the split computing paradigm.},

   they should reduce their execution time and cost. Due to the
   contradictory environment, minimizing the application task's completion
   time and execution cost is extremely difficult. Thus, we propose a Cost
   -aware Quantum -inspired Genetic Algorithm (CQGA) to minimize the
   execution time and cost by meeting the deadline constraints. CQGA is
   motivated by quantum computing and genetic algorithm. It combines
   quantum operators (measure, interference, and rotation) with genetic
   operators (selection, crossover, and mutation). Quantum operators are
   used for better population diversity, quick convergence, time -saving,
   and robustness. Genetic operators help to produce new individuals, have
   good fitness values for individuals, and play a significant role in
   preserving the evolution quality of the population. In addition, CQGA
   used a quantum bit as a probabilistic representation because it has
   higher population diversity attributes than other representations. The
   simulation outcome exhibits that the proposed algorithm can obtain
   outstanding convergence performance and reduced maximum cost than
   benchmark algorithms.},

Journal = {ALGORITHMS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This article aims to bring quantum computing to robotics. A quantum
   algorithm is developed to minimize the distance traveled in warehouses
   and distribution centers where order picking is applied. For this, a
   proof of concept is proposed through a Raspberry Pi 4, generating a
   quantum combinatorial optimization algorithm that saves the distance
   travelled and the batch of orders to be made. In case of computational
   need, the robot will be able to parallelize part of the operations in
   hybrid computing (quantum + classical), accessing CPUs and QPUs
   distributed in a public or private cloud. We developed a stable
   environment (ARM64) inside the robot (Raspberry) to run gradient
   operations and other quantum algorithms on IBMQ, Amazon Braket (D-Wave),
   and Pennylane locally or remotely. The proof of concept, when run in the
   above stated quantum environments, showed the execution time of our
   algorithm with different public access simulators on the market,
   computational results of our picking and batching algorithm, and analyze
   the quantum real-time execution. Our findings are that the behavior of
   the Amazon Braket D-Wave is better than Gate-based Quantum Computing
   over 20 qubits, and that AWS-Braket has better time performance than
   Qiskit or Pennylane.},

Abstract = {Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) represents a reasonable countermeasure to
   the advent of Quantum Computing and its impact on current public-key

Abstract = {Smart Healthcare systems compromise complex computations such as

   These are considered to be complex problems that today's supercomputers

   compute large and complex operations in exponential time. It is a fact
   that Quantum computing will adequately innovate the computation

   to be rare and highly expensive to produce. This paper presents a
   Quantum Cloud-as-a-service for an efficient, scalable, and secure
   solution for complex Smart Healthcare computations. Our novelty resides
   in the usage of Quantum Terminal Machines (QTM) and Blockchain

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {10332-10340},
Abstract = {The security of sensitive information is an urgent need in today's
   communication, principally in cloud and Internet of Things (IoT)
   environments. Therefore, a well-designed security mechanism should be
   carefully considered. This paper presents a new framework for secure
   information in fog cloud IoT. In the framework, the user in one location
   embeds his/her valuable data via the proposed quantum steganography
   protocol and uploads the covered data to the fog cloud. The intended
   receiver in another location accesses the data from the fog cloud and
   extracts the intended content via the proposed extraction approach. This
   paper also presents a novel quantum steganography protocol based on hash
   function and quantum entangled states. To the best of our knowledge,
   there is no prior quantum steganography protocol that authenticates an
   embedded secret message. In the suggested protocol, the hash function is
   utilized to authenticate embedded secret messages. The presented
   protocol is secure against well-known attacks, such as message,
   man-in-the middle, and no-message attacks. In addition, it does not
   consume additional channels besides the proposed one to send a secret
   message or verify security. The proposed approach is nominated for use
   in fog and mobile edge computing.},

Abstract = {The large-scale multimodal sensor fusion of the internet of things (IoT)
   data can be transformed into an N-dimensional classical point cloud. For
   example, the transformation may be the fusion of three imaging
   modalities of different natures such as LiDAR (light imaging, detection,
   and ranging), a set of RGB images, and a set of thermal images. However,
   it is not easy to process a point cloud because it can have millions or
   even hundreds of millions of points. Classical computers therefore often
   crash when operating a point cloud of multimodal sensor data. Quantum
   Point Clouds (QPC) address the problem of uncertainty in multi-modal
   sensor data, such that precognitive/predictive models can be derived
   with outcomes of greater certainty than classical information processing
   methods. This paper presents early experiments of the first application
   of a quantum co-processor hybrid for processing quantum point cloud
   multimodal sensor data from an autonomous racing car. Applied to the
   more complex case of cave mapping, it then describes the first hybrid
   classicalquantum co-processor, comprising a graphical processing unit,
   differential pulse code modulator and a quantum computer. The graphical
   processing unit comprises a multiple input/output data interface,
   transformation means for transforming a fused depth bitmap of the
   multi-modal sensor data into a point cloud representation with world
   coordinates, control logic that manages the multiple input/output data
   interface, and the differential pulse code modulator. The quantum
   co-processor comprises an assembly of quantum computing chips.},

Abstract = {Identity-based encryption with equality test (IBEET) provides a feasible
   way for cloud server partitioning or searching on ciphertexts in the
   cloud. In that case, the server can judge if two different ciphertexts
   encrypt the same plaintexts or not. In response to threats posed by
   quantum computers, lattice-based IBEET schemes have been proposed to
   make cloud service post-quantum secure. However, those schemes are
   inefficient and can hardly meet the needs of resource-constrained
   devices. In this article, an efficient post-quantum IBEET scheme is
   introduced, which achieves testability by embedding the hash value of
   plaintext into testing trapdoor instead of encrypting it directly and
   doubling the size of ciphertext. We also prove that, with the Learning
   With Errors (LWE) problem assumption, the new scheme is one-way secure
   against selective identity and chosen ciphertext attacks (OW-sID-CCA) in
   quantum secure model. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the
   new construction and demonstrate its efficiency by showing that it only
   costs about half storage comparing with other lattice-based IBEET
   schemes. The execution time of encryption and decryption phrases in the
   new scheme reduce by 50\%, while the computational cost in test
   algorithm keeps the same. Therefore, the new proposed IBEET is much more
   practical for working in post-quantum cloud computing scenarios.},

Abstract = {Quantum network simulation is an essential step towards developing
   applications for quantum networks and determining minimal requirements
   for the network hardware. As it is with classical networking, a
   simulation ecosystem allows for application development,
   standardization, and overall community building. Currently, there is
   limited traction towards building a quantum networking community-there
   are limited open-source platforms, challenging frameworks with steep
   learning curves, and strong requirements of software engineering skills.
   Our Quantum Network Development Kit (QNDK) project aims to solve these
   issues. It includes a graphical user interface to easily develop and run
   quantum network simulations with very little code. It integrates various
   quantum network simulation engines and provides a single interface to
   them, allowing users to use the features from any of them. Further, it
   deploys simulation execution in a cloud environment, offloading strong
   computing requirements to a high-performance computing system. In this
   paper, we detail the core features of the QNDK and outline the
   development roadmap to enabling virtual quantum testbeds.},

Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Quantum many-body systems (QMBs) are some of the most challenging
   physical systems to simulate numerically. Methods involving
   approximations for tensor network (TN) contractions have proven to be
   viable alternatives to algorithms such as quantum Monte Carlo or
   simulated annealing. However, these methods are cumbersome, difficult to
   implement, and often have significant limitations in their accuracy and
   efficiency when considering systems in more than one dimension. In this
   paper, we explore the exact computation of TN contractions on
   two-dimensional geometries and present a heuristic improvement of TN
   contraction that reduces the computing time, the amount of memory, and
   the communication time. We run our algorithm for the Ising model using
   memory optimized x1.32x large instances on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
   Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). Our results show that cloud computing is a
   viable alternative to supercomputers for this class of scientific
   applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Cloud storage provides an efficient and convenient way to manage data,
   but it also poses significant challenges to data security. The central
   issue with cloud storage is to ensure the ability of the data owner to
   control and manage the outsourced data. The password-protected secret
   sharing (PPSS) integrates password authentication and secret sharing to
   offer a fresh approach to secure private data. Users can share the risk
   of device corruption with a well-designed PPSS scheme and manage
   outsourced data with only human-memorizable passwords. To the best of
   our knowledge, none of the existing PPSS schemes can resist security
   threats in the post-quantum era, and there is an urgent need to design
   quantum-resistant solutions. However, post-quantum cryptography varies
   significantly from traditional cryptography, and it is challenging to
   design a quantum-resistant password-protected secret-sharing scheme for
   cloud storage. In this work, we take the first substantial step towards
   this challenge by proposing QPause, a quantum-resistant
   password-protected data outsourcing scheme for cloud storage. We first
   design a basic lattice-based PPSS secure against semi-honest adversaries
   with a secure channel. On this foundation, we propose a
   quantum-resistant round-optimal password-protected data outsourcing
   scheme against strong adversaries. In addition, we formally prove that
   our scheme is secure and robust under various attacks against
   adversaries with quantum computing capabilities. The comparison results
   show that our new scheme outperforms its foremost counterparts.},

Abstract = {Fingerprinting is one of the most commonly used techniques for indoor
   localization due to their high accuracy in the presence of the wireless
   channel noise. Nonetheless, they require significant storage overhead
   and running time. This becomes even more important when scaling such
   systems to a worldwide scale.
   Quantum computing can speedup computation of intractable problems that
   are hard to solve on the traditional classical computers. In this paper,
   we propose a realistic quantum fingerprint based algorithm that builds
   on quantum computing concepts to scale. In particular, the proposed
   fingerprinting algorithm can provide exponential enhancement in both
   space and running time over the classical fingerprinting techniques. We
   explain the details of the quantum fingerprint construction, how to
   encode the fingerprint signal strength vectors in quantum states, and
   how to calculate the quantum similarity between the online signal
   strength measurement and the offline ones. In addition, we study the
   different practical implementation and deployment issues on IBM quantum
   computing cloud machines.
   Implementation and evaluation of our algorithm in a real testbed using
   quantum machines confirms its ability to correctly obtain the estimated
   location with an exponential enhancement in both time and space compared
   to the traditional classical fingerprinting techniques. This highlights
   the promise of our algorithm to scale fingerprinting localization to be
   used globally.},

   cloud and distributed computing, and the long-running nature of these
   algorithms. The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason
   about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and
   asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics
   allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The
   flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add
   functionality using any language or environment. With Tierkreis, quantum
   software developers can easily build, visualise, verify, test, and debug
   complex hybrid workflows, and immediately deploy them to the cloud or a
   custom distributed environment.},

Title = {Permutation invariant encodings for quantum machine learning with point
   cloud data},
Journal = {QUANTUM MACHINE INTELLIGENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Quantum computing offers a potentially powerful new method for
   performing machine learning. However, several quantum machine learning
   techniques have been shown to exhibit poor generalisation as the number
   of qubits increases. We address this issue by demonstrating a
   permutation invariant quantum encoding method, which exhibits superior
   generalisation performance, and apply it to point cloud data
   (three-dimensional images composed of points). Point clouds naturally
   contain permutation symmetry with respect to the ordering of their
   points, making them a natural candidate for this technique. Our method
   captures this symmetry in a quantum encoding that contains an equal
   quantum superposition of all permutations and is therefore invariant
   under point order permutation. We test this encoding method in numerical
   simulations using a quantum support vector machine to classify point
   clouds drawn from either spherical or toroidal geometries. We show that
   a permutation invariant encoding improves in accuracy as the number of
   points contained in the point cloud increases, while non-invariant
   quantum encodings decrease in accuracy. This demonstrates that by
   implementing permutation invariance into the encoding, the model
   exhibits improved generalisation.},

Abstract = {With the increasing popularity of cloud storage, data security on the
   cloud has become increasingly visible. Searchable encryption has the
   ability to realize the privacy protection and security of data in the
   cloud. However, with the continuous development of quantum computing,
   the standard Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) scheme
   cannot resist quantum based keyword guessing attacks. Further, the
   credibility of the server also poses a significant threat to the
   security of the retrieval process. This paper proposes a searchable
   encryption scheme based on lattice cryptography using blockchain to
   address the above problems. Firstly, we design a lattice-based
   encryption primitive to resist quantum keyword guessing attacks.
   Moreover, blockchain is to decentralize the cloud storage platform's
   jurisdiction of data. It also ensures that the traceability of keyword
   retrieval process and maintains the credibility of search result, which
   malicious platforms are prevented as much as possible from deliberately
   sending wrong search results. Last but not least, through security
   analysis, our proposed scheme satisfies the credibility and
   unforgeability of the keyword ciphertext. The comprehensive performance
   evaluates that our scheme has certain advantages in terms of efficiency
   compared with others.},

Abstract = {Cloud resource demands are rapidly increasing exponentially with the
   development of cloud computing. For this sake, new modern methods and
   techniques are needed to improve its quality of service. In this work,
   the problem of resource distribution management in cloud computing is
   formulated as an optimisation problem. To this end, we exploit the
   constrained quantum optimisation algorithm (CQOA) in resource
   distribution management by considering queueing aspect in order to
   optimise and improve its performance in terms of computational
   complexity, accuracy, and energy consumption. Next, we study the
   implementation and the configuration of the CQOA. After, we investigate
   the computational complexity of selecting the optimal distribution
   scenario that corresponds to minimum energy consumption. We also express
   the lower and upper bounds of the overall possible assignment scenarios
   within the database. Finally, we validate the efficiency of the proposed
   implemented CQOA by constructing a simulation environment.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing is an emerging field of high interest. Many companies
   have started to work on developing more powerful and stable quantum
   computers. However, developers still struggle to master the art of
   programming with a quantum computer. One of the major challenges faced
   is the integration of quantum parts of a system with the classical one.
   This paper proposes a novel development model called
   Quantum-Algorithms-as-a-Service (QAaaS). This new model aims to allow
   developers to abstract the quantum components away from the design of
   the software they are building. The model leverages
   Software-as-a-Service and Function-as-a-Service to support multiple
   quantum cloud providers and run their algorithms regardless of the

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era has begun, a quantum
   neural network (QNN) is definitely a promising solution to many problems
   that classical neural networks cannot solve. In addition, a quantum
   convolutional neural network (QCNN) is now receiving a lot of attention
   because it can process high dimensional inputs comparing to QNN.
   However, due to the nature of quantum computing, it is difficult to
   scale up the QCNN to extract a sufficient number of features due to
   barren plateaus. This is especially challenging in classification
   operations with high-dimensional data input. However, due to the nature
   of quantum computing, it is difficult to scale up the QCNN to extract a
   sufficient number of features due to barren plateaus. This is especially
   challenging in classification operations with high dimensional data
   input. Motivated by this, a novel stereoscopic 3D scalable QCNN
   (sQCNN-3D) is proposed for point cloud data processing in classification
   applications. Furthermore, reverse fidelity training (RF-Train) is
   additionally considered on top of sQCNN-3D for diversifying features
   with a limited number of qubits using the fidelity of quantum computing.
   Our data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that the proposed
   algorithm achieves desired performance.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to
   revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult
   to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but
   functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud,
   allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage
   their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems
   providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many
   video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a
   homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each
   built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.).
   Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem
   because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists
   interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help
   the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic
   computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to
   solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical
   operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We
   propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box
   recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and
   has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness,
   limitations and possible future directions of development.},

   security to the cloud data in the cloud storage services. Most of the
   traditional attribute based encryption techniques are applied on small
   datasets to generate constant size cipher text using limited computing
   resources. In the existing attribute based techniques, most of the
   attributes are considered as textual information and static values for
   key generation, data encryption and decryption process. To overcome
   these issues, a novel dynamic chaotic map based hashing is implemented
   to improve the security of the quantum based CP-ABE model. In the
   proposed model, user's attribute are secured using the dynamic chaotic
   map function for key initialization, data encoding and decoding process.
   In this model, both structured and unstructured large medical data are
   taken as input for integrity verification and encryption process.
   Practical simulation results show that the presented model has better
   accuracy in terms of cloud data encryption and decryption time and
   computed memory compared to the existing attribute based encryption and
   decryption techniques.},

Abstract = {Modern computing environments, thanks to the advent of enabling
   technologies such as Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC), effectively
   represent a Cloud Continuum, a capillary network of computing resources
   that extend from the Edge of the network to the Cloud, which enables a
   dynamic and adaptive service fabric. Efficiently coordinating resource
   allocation, exploitation, and management in the Cloud Continuum
   represents quite a challenge, which has stimulated researchers to
   investigate innovative solutions based on smart techniques such as
   Reinforcement Learning and Computational Intelligence. In this paper, we
   make a comparison of different optimization algorithms and a first
   investigation of how they can perform in this kind of scenario.
   Specifically, this comparison included the Deep Q-Network, Proximal
   Policy Optimization, Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization,
   Quantum-inspired Particle Swarm Optimization, Multi-Swarm Particle
   Optimization, and the Grey-Wolf Optimizer. We demonstrate how all
   approaches can solve the service management problem with similar
   performance-with a different sample efficiency-if a high number of
   samples can be evaluated for training and optimization. Finally, we show
   that, if the scenario conditions change,
   Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based approaches can exploit the experience
   built during training to adapt service allocation according to the
   modified conditions.},

Abstract = {Cloud storage and computing offer significant convenience and management
   efficiency in the information era. Privacy protection is a major
   challenge in cloud computing. Public key encryption with keyword search
   (PEKS) is an ingenious tool for ensuring both privacy and functionality
   in certain scenarios, such as ensuring privacy for data retrieval
   appearing in cloud computing. Despite much attention received, PEKS
   schemes still face several challenges in practical applications, such as
   low computational efficiency, high end-to-end delay, vulnerability to
   inside keyword guessing attacks, and key management defects in
   multi-user scenarios. In this work, we first propose a post-quantum
   secure PEKS scheme in the standard model. The resulting PEKS scheme is
   based on Ring-LWE/ISIS assumptions. Then, we present two extended
   schemes. The first is a public-key authenticated encryption with keyword
   search scheme, which prevents servers from initiating inside keyword
   guessing attacks. The second is an identity-based public-key
   authenticated encryption with keyword search scheme, which reduces the
   complexity of key management in practical applications. Theoretical
   analyses prove that these schemes enjoy high security. Experimental
   results indicate that these schemes provide lower end-to-end delay and
   higher computational efficiency compared to similar ones.},

Abstract = {Mixed reality, Artificial intelligence and Quantum Compute are
   disruptive technologies that are lighting up new capabilities and
   enabling new manufacturing business models around the intelligent cloud
   and intelligent edge.
   The notion of an application or experience is becoming more distributed
   across devices. No application or experience will be a single device
   experience; every experience is going to be multi-device and is going to
   be multi-sense.
   Every one of these experiences is going to be deeply infused with AI. AI
   is going to be everywhere: in our networks, in our datacenters, in our
   devices and in every application.
   As we have this more complex AI-infused distributed fabric, we need new
   breakthroughs to manage our complex issues. This is where an
   event-driven, serverless compute processing will be very important. And
   this will be distributed from cloud to edge.
   Quantum computing takes a giant leap forward from today's technology-one
   that will forever alter our economic, industrial, academic, and societal
   landscape. In just hours, a quantum computer can solve complex problems
   that would otherwise take billions of years for classical computing to
   solve. This has massive implications for research in energy,
   environmental systems, smart materials, and more.
   Digital technologies are transforming business as we see it today.},

Title = {Practical multi-party quantum homomorphic encryption},
Journal = {THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {971},
Month = {SEP 6},
Abstract = {Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) is allowed to perform operations on
   encrypted data which is very useful for delegated quantum computing in
   quantum cloud environ-ments. But most of current QHE schemes only
   consider the single-user and single-server model. To be more practical
   and suitable for quantum networks, multi-party QHE based on quantum
   voting is considered in this paper. Firstly, an improved quantum voting
   scheme is proposed to facilitate anonymous broadcast. Secondly, a
   multi-party QHE scheme is pro-posed based on the improved quantum voting
   method. The proposed QHE scheme becomes more practical and flexible due
   to the reduction of the cost of delegated quantum compu-tation, which
   significantly contributes to broadening the applicability of QHE in

Abstract = {Homomorphic encryption has been an area of study in classical computing
   for decades. The fundamental goal of homomorphic encryption is to enable
   (untrusted) Oscar to perform a computation for Alice without Oscar
   knowing the input to the computation or the output from the computation.
   Alice encrypts the input before sending it to Oscar, and Oscar performs
   the computation directly on the encrypted data, producing an encrypted
   result. Oscar then sends the encrypted result of the computation back to
   Alice, who can decrypt it. We describe an approach to homomorphic
   encryption for quantum annealing based on spin reversal transformations
   and show that it comes with little or no performance penalty. This is in
   contrast to approaches to homomorphic encryption for classical
   computing, which incur a significant additional computational cost. This
   implies that the performance gap between quantum annealing and classical
   computing is reduced when both paradigms use homomorphic encryption.
   Further, homomorphic encryption is critical for quantum annealing
   because quantum annealers are native to the cloud - a third party (such
   as untrusted Oscar) performs the computation. If sensitive information,
   such as health-related data subject to the Health Insurance Portability
   and Accountability Act, is to be processed with quantum annealers, such
   a technique could be useful.},

Title = {Trustworthy and reliable computing using untrusted and unreliable
   quantum hardware},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {AUG 26},
Abstract = {Security and reliability are primary concerns in any computing paradigm,
   including quantum computing. Currently, users can access quantum
   computers through a cloud-based platform where they can run their
   programs on a suite of quantum computers. As the quantum computing
   ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect
   that more companies including untrusted/less-trusted/unreliable vendors
   will begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at varied
   price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is
   expensive and the access queue could be long, the users will be
   motivated to use the cheaper and readily available but
   unreliable/less-trusted hardware. The less-trusted vendors can tamper
   with the results, providing a sub-optimal solution to the user. For
   applications such as, critical infrastructure optimization, the inferior
   solution may have significant socio-political implications. Since
   quantum computers cannot be simulated in classical computers, users have
   no way of verifying the computation outcome. In this paper, we address
   this challenge by modeling adversarial tampering and simulating it's
   impact on both pure quantum and hybrid quantum-classical workloads. To
   achieve trustworthy computing in a mixed environment of trusted and
   untrusted hardware, we propose an equitable distribution of total shots
   (i.e., repeated executions of quantum programs) across hardware options.
   On average, we note approximate to 30X and approximate to 1.5X
   improvement across the pure quantum workloads and a maximum improvement
   of approximate to 5X for hybrid-classical algorithm in the chosen
   quality metrics. We also propose an intelligent run adaptive shot
   distribution heuristic leveraging temporal variation in hardware quality
   to user's advantage, allowing them to identify tampered/untrustworthy
   hardware at runtime and allocate more number of shots to the reliable
   hardware, which results in a maximum improvement of approximate to 190X
   and approximate to 9X across the pure quantum workloads and an
   improvement of up to approximate to 2.5X for hybrid-classical algorithm.},

Abstract = {Datacenters depend on intelligent management of underlying CPU, memory,
   network, and storage resources. A variety of techniques such as load
   balancing, load consolidation, and remote memory allocation rely on
   successful prediction of the workloads within the cloud. Recent
   promising developments in quantum computing seem ideal for performing
   this overhead work. As a step towards this goal, this paper proposes a
   host resource usage prediction approach, based on a complex-valued
   neural network. The algorithm can be further modified in the future to
   be applicable to quantum computing environments. A proof-of-concept is
   evaluated on real world load traces from a grid. The algorithm is
   compared against some current state-of-the-art host-load prediction
   algorithms to demonstrate its accuracy.},

Abstract = {IBM Q (https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) represents a great
   opportunity offered by IBM to the quantum research community allowing
   running experiments, through a web interface, on several of their
   quantum systems on the cloud. One of the great technical challenges
   tomaking viable quantum computers is their qubit fidelity
   (quality/reliability) together with a plethora of error correction
   techniques-which, obviously, link to reliability theory. Hammock
   networks (a device-level alternative to gate-level reliability schemes)
   have shown outstanding reliability enhancements in the classical digital
   domain (e.g., about two-orders of magnitude better than gate-level von
   Neumann multiplexing). In spite of such performances, device-level
   reliability schemes in general, and hammock networks in particular, have
   never been assessed for quantum computations. A likely explanation is
   that device-level reliability seems much more akin to topological
   quantum computing concepts. That is why we have decided to test if and
   how much hammock networks might help in the quantum realm. Instead of
   theoretical analyses we have decided to perform simulations on IBM Q
   (unfortunately still gate-level constrained), and we report our
   preliminary findings in this paper.},

Abstract = {With the escalation of multimedia data, cloud technology has played a
   very important role in its management with its promising computing and
   storage capabilities. Cloud computing leverages high scalability,
   resources, and on-demand services, which have a remarkable impact on
   assisting multimedia data storage. Meanwhile, any alteration in the
   outsourced multimedia data is a severe menace. Numerous researchers have
   focused on providing validation of integrity through the auditing
   mechanism. Regrettably, their mechanisms are focused on the traditional
   public-key cryptosystem and cannot withstand quantum attacks.
   Additionally, the centralised approach of completely relying on a
   third-party auditor (TPA) of existing mechanisms may lead to biased
   auditing results. Hence, employing the advantage of resistance against
   quantum attack and removing the liability of certificates with lattice
   cryptography and an identity-based cryptosystem, we have presented a new
   auditing framework by utilising blockchain technology. Blockchain
   technology is employed in order to track the activities of the cloud
   service provider and TPA, resulting less dependency on TPA. Security
   analysis portrays security of the framework under the random oracle
   model, which depends is based on the Shortest Integer Solution (SIS)
   problem of the lattices. Reduced computation, communication and storage
   overheads with efficient features and performance is observed for the
   proposed mechanism through analysis conducted with similar mechanisms.
   As a result, better operability is achieved by the proposed mechanism.},

Title = {Practical revocable and multi-authority CP-ABE scheme from RLWE for
   Cloud Computing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cloud computing provides enterprises and individuals with unlimited
   computing resources and expandable storage space. However, data leakage
   occurs frequently due to the lack of protection measures in the cloud
   storage environment. Consequently, how to protect data security in the
   cloud has become a critical issue. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is
   an emerging encryption technique, which protects sensitive information
   and provides access control for data stored in the cloud. However, most
   of existing ABE schemes cannot resist quantum attacks and lack the
   capability of implementing flexible revocation on user or attribute when
   the attributes of a user change, which hinders the practical application
   of ABE. In this research, we present a Revocable and Multi-authority
   ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (RM-CP-ABE) from the ring
   learning with errors (RLWE) assumption, which supports multi-authority
   and multi-valued attributes. The scheme allows multiple authorities to
   involve in key distribution, and achieves the attribute revocation when
   the user's access rights change. Also, the scheme enjoys reasonable
   computational cost and storage overhead, and is proven selectively
   secure under the RLWE assumption. The simulation results indicate that
   the performance of the proposed scheme is acceptable for practical
   applications.},

Abstract = {The forthcoming of the Internet of Things has opened the gates for
   numerous applications in several domains. Unfortunately, it also has
   brought along with it several security challenges. IoT devices, being
   compact in size, has several constraints. Therefore, it becomes a
   challenging task to define security protocols suitable for such
   constrained devices. Also, the significant strides made towards the
   development of Quantum computers pose a huge threat to traditionally
   used cryptosystems. It is known that a sufficiently large Quantum
   Computer running Shor's Algorithm can solve the integer factorization
   problem and the discrete logarithm problem. Thus, in our research, we
   provide an authentication protocol that utilizes Gate Way Node for
   high-end processing and suggest the usage of NTRU cryptosystem as the
   cipher suite. We suggest our authentication protocol in terms of cloud
   computing, as the number of IoT devices would be immense and cloud
   computing is better suited for processing and storing such large volumes
   of data. We also suggest the use of One Time Password, for adding
   another layer of security on top of the public-key cryptosystem. We
   analyze our authentication protocol and find that it is safe.},

Abstract = {Sensor-powered devices offer safe global connections, cloud scalability

   that have historically obstructed major innovations in technology can be
   addressed by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine

   applications on the edge device near the data source rather than in a

   make inferences in real time through predictive models, real-time
   machine learning has not yet been fully adopted. Real-time machine
   learning utilizes real-time data to learn on the go, which helps in
   faster and more accurate real-time predictions and eliminates the need
   to store data eradicating privacy issues. In this article, we present

Abstract = {INFN has been running a distributed infrastructure (the Tier-1 at
   Bologna-CNAF and 9 Tier-2 centres) for more than 20 years which
   currently offers about 150000 CPU cores and 120 PB of space both in tape
   and disk storage, serving more than 40 international scientific
   collaborations. This Grid-based infrastructure was augmented in 2019
   with the INFN Cloud: a production quality multi-site federated Cloud
   infrastructure, composed by a core backbone, and which is able to
   integrate other INFN sites and public or private Clouds as well. The
   INFN Cloud provides a customizable and extensible portfolio offering
   computing and storage services spanning the IaaS, PaaS and SaaS layers,
   with dedicated solutions to serve special purposes, such as
   ISO-certified regions for the handling of sensitive data. INFN is now
   revising and expanding its infrastructure to tackle the challenges
   expected in the next 10 years of scientific computing adopting a
   ``cloud-first{''} approach, through which all the INFN data centres will
   be federated via the INFN Cloud middleware and integrated with key HPC
   centres, such as the pre-exascale Leonardo machine at CINECA. In such a
   process, which involves both the infrastructures and the higher level
   services, initiatives and projects such as the ``Italian National Centre
   on HPC, Big Data and Quantum Computing{''} (funded in the context of the
   Italian ``National Recovery and Resilience Plan{''}) and the Bologna
   Technopole are precious opportunities that will be exploited to offer
   advanced resources and services to universities, research institutions
   and industry. In this paper we describe how INFN is evolving its
   computing infrastructure, with the ambition to create and operate a
   national vendorneutral, open, scalable, and flexible ``datalake{''} able
   to serve much more than just INFN users and experiments.},

Abstract = {Present-day quantum computers suffer from various noises or errors such
   as, gate error, relaxation, dephasing, readout error, and crosstalk.
   Besides, they offer a limited number of qubits with restrictive
   connectivity. Therefore, quantum programs running these computers face
   resilience issues and low output fidelities. The noise in the
   cloud-based access of quantum computers also introduce new modes of
   security and privacy issues. Furthermore, quantum computers face several
   threat models from insider and outsider adversaries including input
   tampering, program misallocation, fault injection, Reverse Engineering
   (RE) and Cloning. This paper provides an overview of various assets
   embedded in quantum computers and programs, vulnerabilities and attack
   models and the relation between resilience and security. We also cover
   countermeasures against the reliability and security issues and present
   future outlook for security of quantum computing.},

Abstract = {Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to
   solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently.
   Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical
   applications. To bring these composite applications into production,
   technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required
   to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For
   non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been
   developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum
   applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum
   applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the
   deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we
   propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on
   the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications
   (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of
   quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all
   technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style
   supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing
   model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a
   SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate
   the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an
   extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with
   IBMQ and a quantum simulator.},

Abstract = {Quantum Computing is one of the most promising technology advancements
   of our time, promising to clarify problems considered unsolved for a
   classical computer. Real Quantum Computer Devices-once a science fiction
   concept-are now a reality. Many challenges still remain, on the way to
   achieve the so-called quantum supremacy. A phenomenon called Quantum
   Decoherence is the main cause of noise, making the available Quantum
   Computer Devices now limited to a few dozens of qubits at present.
   Despite that, most of the IT giants as IBM, Google and Rigetti are
   investing large amounts of money on deferent technological approaches to
   implement such devices and giving free access through the cloud not only
   to researchers but to common users also. So, it is important to evaluate
   and compare Quantum Computers of different philosophy, a process far
   more difficult than the equivalent for a classical computer. Quantum
   Volume represents a metric which measures the Quantum Computing Devices'
   reliability in terms of error rates. In this paper, quantum circuits
   implementing Hadamard and CNOT gates were examined on three dif-ferent
   IBM Quantum Computer Devices in order to experimentally investigate
   Quantum Volume and attempt to provide a meaning of this metric. Data of
   these experiments are presented and additionally, different metrics are
   used to compare the performance of the Quantum Computer Devices.},

Abstract = {The expeditious and meteoric advancement in the ever-transforming
   transportation industry has paved the way for harmonizing and
   mellifluous development of the intelligent internet of vehicular things
   (IIoVT). Cloud computing and edge computing have resulted in numerous
   applications that are well deployed within smart cities to meet the
   spike in demand for low latency, coupled with mobility in practical
   IIoVT deployment. However, the underlying security of such applications
   depends on the time complexity of mathematical hard problems. The
   arrival of quantum computers has reduced computational time
   exponentially, thus making such applications vulnerable. Therefore, this
   article investigates the proposed quantum communicationbased secure
   architecture for edge-driven IIoVT applications. The proposed
   architecture, utilizing quantum communication protocol, provides a new
   platform for developing IIoVT applications ensuring unconditional
   security and eavesdropper detection. Also, the paper presents a case
   study, namely, a quantum secured intelligent edge-driven road condition
   monitoring application that features automatic road conditions
   detection, subsequently recommending transport authorities periodically.
   Finally, future research directions are presented with a security
   perspective in IIoVT.},

Abstract = {Cloud-assisted Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) relies on cloud
   computing to provide massive data storage services. To ensure the
   confidentiality, sensitive industrial data need to be encrypted before
   being outsourced to cloud storage server. Public-key encryption with
   keyword search (PEKS) enables users to search target encrypted data by
   keywords. However, most existing PEKS schemes are based on conventional
   hardness assumptions, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with
   quantum computers in the near future. Moreover, they suffer from key
   exposure, and thus the security would be broken once the keys are
   compromised. In this paper, we propose a forward secure PEKS scheme
   (FS-PEKS) based on lattice assumptions for cloud-assisted IIoT, which is
   post-quantum secure. We integrate a lattice-based delegation mechanism
   into FS-PEKS to achieve forward security, such that the security of the
   system is still guaranteed even the keys are compromised by the
   adversaries. We define the first formal security model on forward
   security of PEKS, and prove the security of FS-PEKS under the model. As
   the keywords of industrial data are with inherently low entropy, we
   further extend FS-PEKS to resist insider keyword guessing attacks
   (IKGA). The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that
   FS-PEKS is practical for cloud-assisted IIoT.},

Year = {2024},

Pages = {43410-43421},
Abstract = {The use of quantum satellites can be significant paving the way for
   novel telecommunications network paradigms, making it possible to
   connect remote regions. Given the rapid development of quantum
   communication technologies, many studies are focusing on quantum
   satellites interconnections via Free Space Optic (FSO), especially
   considering that the adoption of wired alternatives did not achieve
   significant results, mainly in terms of covering long distances. In this
   context, the global interconnection of Quantum Computers (QCs) through
   the so-called Quantum Internet (QI) compels for new communications and
   computing architectures such as Quantum Cloud (QCloud). To this purpose,
   the deployment of Satellite Quantum Networks (SQNs) could make easily
   available innovative services spanning from security to advanced
   computing, especially by using Software-Defined Networking (SDN)
   technology, which is considered a significant enabler for the management
   of SQNs. Moreover, considering the rapid variability of the topology in
   terms of nodes and links features, the paper proposes a specific
   Temporal Networks (TNs) optimization strategy embedded in an SDN
   Controller ecosystem, dynamically optimizing the path durations to
   achieve the highest entanglement rate, while limiting the
   disconnections. Performance evaluation in a worst case scenario shows
   that the proposed framework is able to support distributed applications
   by exploiting all the connection opportunities.},

Title = {QNMF: A quantum neural network based multimodal fusion system for
   intelligent diagnosis},
Journal = {INFORMATION FUSION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {100},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged as a significant
   research area in the medical field, enabling the transmission of various
   types of data to the cloud for analysis and diagnosis. Fusing data from
   multiple modalities can enhance accuracy but requires substantial
   computing power. Theoretically, quantum computers can rapidly process
   large volumes of high-dimensional medical data. Despite accelerated
   developments in quantum computing, research on quantum machine learning
   (QML) for multimodal data processing remains limited. Considering these
   factors, this paper presents a quantum neural network-based multimodal
   fusion system for intelligent diagnosis (QNMF) that can process
   multimodal medical data transmitted by IoMT devices, fuse data from
   different modalities, and improve the performance of intelligent
   diagnosis. This system employs a quantum convolutional neural network
   (QCNN) to efficiently extract features from medical images. These
   QCNN-based features are then fused with other modality features (such as
   blood test results or breast cell slices), and used to train an
   effective variational quantum classifier (VQC) for intelligent
   diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that a QCNN can
   effectively extract image data features. Furthermore, QNMF achieved an
   accuracy of 97.07\% and 97.61\% on breast cancer diagnosis and Covid-19
   diagnosis experiments, respectively. In addition, the QNMF exhibits
   strong quantum noise robustness.},

Abstract = {Currently, Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) computing is considered as one of
   the advanced fields of Information Technology (IT) industries. DNA
   computing is a technique inspired from biological science that makes the
   use of DNA bases, namely Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T), and
   Cytosine (C), for operations and as an information carrier. L. M.
   Adleman first brought forth this concept in 1994. DNA computing has many
   advantages, such as parallel computing, large storage capability,
   minimal power requirement, and molecular computation. Nowadays, it is
   used in different fields, including cryptography, steganography, big
   data storage, quantum computing, DNA chip, and medical application. In
   this chapter, the fundamentals of human DNA and DNA computing, including
   the structure of DNA, polymerase chain reaction, history, advantages,
   disadvantages, operations of DNA computing, etc., have been discussed in
   detail. In addition, many applications of DNA computing in different
   fields, namely cryptography, steganography, big data, cloud computing,
   DNA chip, medical research are also presented, which can be highly
   beneficial for the researchers, academicians, and other professionals
   doing their research in DNA computing.},

Abstract = {ICSC ({''}Italian Center for SuperComputing{''}) is one of the five
   Italian National Centres created within the framework of the
   NextGenerationEU funding by the European Commission. The aim of ICSC,
   designed and approved through 2022 and eventually started in September
   2022, is to create the national digital infrastructure for research and
   innovation, leveraging existing HPC, HTC and Big Data infrastructures
   and evolving towards a cloud data-lake model. It will be available to
   the scientific and industrial communities through flexible and uniform
   cloud web interfaces and will be relying on a high-level support team;
   as such, it will form a globally attractive ecosystem based on strategic
   public-private partnerships to fully exploit top level digital
   infrastructure for scientific and technical computing and promote the
   development of new computing technologies. The ICSC IT infrastructure is
   built upon existing scientific digital infrastructures as provided by
   the major national players: GARR, the Italian NREN, provides the network
   infrastructure, whose capacity will be upgraded to multiples of Tbps;
   CINECA hosts Leonardo, one of the world largest HPC systems, with a
   power of over 250 Pflops, to be further increased and complemented with
   a quantum computer; INFN contributes with its distributed Big Data cloud
   infrastructure, built in the last decades to respond to the needs of the
   HEP community. On top of the IT infrastructure, several thematic
   activities will be funded and will focus on the development of tools and
   applications in several research domains. Of particular relevance to
   this audience are the activities on ``Fundamental Research and Space
   Economy{''} and ``Astrophysics and Cosmos Observations{''}, strictly
   aligned with the INFN and HEP core activities. Finally, two
   technological research activities will foster research on ``Future HPC
   and Big Data{''} and ``Quantum Computing{''}.},

Abstract = {In recent years, quantum computing has undergone significant
   developments and has established its supremacy in many application
   domains. While quantum hardware is accessible to the public through the
   cloud environment, a robust and efficient quantum circuit simulator is
   necessary to investigate the constraints and foster quantum computing
   development, such as quantum algorithm development and quantum device
   architecture exploration. In this paper, we observe that most of the
   publicly available quantum circuit simulators (e.g., QISKit from IBM,
   QDK from Microsoft, and Qsim-Cirq from Google) suffer from slow
   simulation and poor scalabfiity when the number of qubits increases. To
   this end, we systematically investigate the deficiencies in quantum
   circuit simulation (QCS) and propose Q-GPU, a framework that leverages
   GPUs with comprehensive optimizations to allow efficient and scalable
   QCS. Specifically, Q-GPU features i) proactive state amplitude transfer,
   ii) zero state amplitude pruning, iii) delayed qubit involvement, and
   iv) lossless non-zero state amplitude compression. Experimental results
   across nine representative quantum circuits indicate that Q-GPU
   significantly reduces the execution time of the state-of-the-art
   GPU-based QCS by 71.89\% (3.55x speedup). Q-GPU also outperforms the
   state-of-the-art OpenMP CPU implementation, the Google Qsim-Cirq
   simulator, and the Microsoft QDK simulator by 1.49 x, 2.02 x, and 10.82
   x, respectively.},

Abstract = {Secret sharing schemes are used as a tool in many cryptographic
   protocols including revocable electronic cash, electronic voting, cloud
   computing and key management in sensor networks. But the existing
   post-quantum secret sharing schemes are all based on Shamir's (t, n)
   threshold scheme, there is currently no post-quantum secret sharing
   scheme based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), so we construct a
   verifiable lattice-based secret sharing scheme using some number theory
   methods and interaction methods. Furthermore, we prove our scheme is
   safe in the post-quantum era. Finally, we compare our scheme with other
   schemes. And the comparison shows that our scheme is more efficient and
   occupies less memory.},

Title = {Shuttle-Exploiting Attacks and Their Defenses in Trapped-Ion Quantum
   Computers},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {2686-2699},
Abstract = {Trapped-ion (TI) quantum bits are a front-runner technology for quantum
   computing. TI systems with multiple interconnected traps can overcome
   the hardware connectivity issue inherent in superconducting qubits and
   can solve practical problems at scale. With a sufficient number of
   qubits on the horizon, the multi-programming model for Quantum Computers
   (QC) has been proposed where multiple users share the same QC for their
   computing. Multi-programming is enticing for quantum cloud providers as
   it can maximize device utilization, throughput, and profit for clouds.
   Users can also benefit from the short wait queue. However, shared access
   to quantum computers can create new security issues. This paper presents
   one such vulnerability in shared TI systems that require shuttle
   operations for communication among traps. Repeated shuttle operations
   increase quantum bit energy and degrade the reliability of computations
   (fidelity). We show adversarial program design approaches requiring
   numerous shuttles. We propose a random and systematic methodology for
   adversary program generation. Our analysis shows shuttle-exploiting
   attacks can substantially degrade the fidelities of victim programs by
   to approximate to 2x to approximate to 63x. Finally, we present several
   countermeasures such as adopting a hybrid initial mapping policy,
   padding victim programs with dummy qubits, and capping maximum shuttles.},

Title = {An Efficient Identity-Based Proxy Blind Signature for Semioffline
   Services},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2018},
Abstract = {Fog computing extends the cloud computing to the network edge and allows
   deploying a newtype of semioffline services, which can provide real-time
   transactions between two entities, while the central cloud server is
   offline and network edge devices are online. For an e-payment system and
   e-voting with such feature, proxy blind signature is a cornerstone to
   protect users' privacy. However, the signature based on number theorem,
   such as hard mathematical problems on factoring problem, discrete
   logarithm problem, and bilinear pairings, cannot defeat quantum
   computers attack. Meanwhile, these schemes need to depend on complex
   public key infrastructure. Thus, we construct an identity-based proxy
   blind signature scheme based on number theorem research unit lattice,
   which can defeat quantum computers attack and does not need to depend on
   public key infrastructure. Thesecurity of the proposed scheme is
   dependent on Ring-Small Integer Solution problem over number theorem
   research unit lattice. The proposed scheme meets the properties of blind
   signature and proxy signature. Then we compare the proposed scheme with
   other existing proxy blind signature schemes; the result shows that the
   proposed scheme outperforms ZM scheme except in proxy signer's signature
   size and can be more secure than TA scheme andMMHP scheme.},

Abstract = {As a bridge between cloud computing platforms and the Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices, edge computing provides various on-demand data services
   to reduce latency and network congestion. To ensure data security in
   edge computing, sensitive data should be encrypted before being
   outsourced to edge servers. Public key encryption with keyword search
   (PEKS) can provide search service for encrypted data. Nevertheless, most
   existing PEKS schemes are susceptible to quantum attacks because their
   security assumptions are based on traditional hardness assumptions.
   Moreover, many lattice based PEKS schemes only apply to the single-user
   scenario, limiting the range of applications. In this paper, we present
   an efficient lattice-based public key searchable encryption with
   fine-grained access control for edge computing. Our scheme achieves
   post-quantum security and highly flexible access control policies for
   multi-user applications, by utilizing the learning with errors (LWE)
   assumption and subset predicate encryption. The security proof
   illustrates that our proposed scheme is secure under chosen plaintext
   attacks and chosen keyword attacks. Finally, extensive experiments on
   real-world datasets illustrate that our encryption algorithm is faster
   than existing approaches. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {With the large-scale application of cloud storage, how to ensure cloud
   data integrity has become an important issue. Although many methods have
   been proposed, they still have their limitations. This paper improves
   some defects of the previous methods and proposes an efficient cloud

   we proposed a lattice signature algorithm to resist quantum computing
   and introduced cuckoo filter to simplify the computational overhead of
   the user verification phase. Finally, the decentralized blockchain
   network is introduced to replace traditional centralized audit to
   publicize and authenticate the verification results, which improves the
   transparency and the security of this scheme. Security analysis shows
   that our scheme can resist malicious attacks and experimental results
   show that our scheme has high efficiency, especially in the user

Abstract = {Post-quantum ciphers (PQC) secure the digital networking of the current
   computers against a quantum-computing-equipped adversary. The National
   Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) selected post-quantum
   digital signature algorithms for standardization. To prepare for the
   transition to PQC, we study the feasibility of integrating the
   NIST-standardized PQC digital signatures into the existing networking
   protocols, which include TCP/TLS and the more advanced QUIC. We study
   the behavior and performances of implementing PQC signatures for HTTP
   networking built on TCP/TLS and QUIC. Our experiment-based studies use
   remote cloud servers across the globe to simulate and measure the
   real-world networking behaviors. Focusing on the post-quantum
   lattice-based ciphers of Dilithium and Falcon, our results show that
   QUIC generally outperforms TCP/TLS (by 52\% with RSA, 2.5\% or greater
   with Dilithium algorithms, and 32.8\% or greater with Falcon
   algorithms). Based on the QUIC performances and the protocol handshake
   duration overhead between the client and the cloud server, we recommend
   Falcon for the QUIC-based networking applications for quicker handshake
   and less variance if the devices can afford the hardware for
   floating-point-based operations.},

Abstract = {We model the hardware and software architecture for generalized Internet
   of Things (IoT) by quantum cloud-computing and blockchain. To reduce the
   measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement
   (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum
   computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by
   modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and
   obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information
   formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the
   channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with
   generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among
   different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a
   resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in
   cognitive radio: the first one is on users' selection in a `win-lose'
   manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a
   `win-win' manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a
   saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash
   equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of
   our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical
   examples.},

Abstract = {In recent times, there has been a considerable increase in Cloud-Based
   applications and infrastructure. This has led to quicker innovations,
   agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet,
   improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new
   technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused
   applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest
   in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different
   sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the
   on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic,
   scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to
   host the client applications and services. We present how the major
   Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving
   their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many
   factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center
   to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select
   a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data
   center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are
   currently working on. The final goal is to have a cross-platform
   advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich
   repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability
   metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their
   preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide
   any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud
   service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action
   will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them
   an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score
   is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon
   footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud.},

Title = {Identity-Based Encryption With Disjunctive, Conjunctive and Range
   Keyword Search From Lattices},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {19},
Pages = {8644-8657},
Abstract = {To reduce data storage costs, more individuals are using cloud servers
   for reliable, scalable, cost-effective, and globally accessible
   solutions. However, storing data in plaintext on cloud servers can lead
   to data leakage risks. Moreover, the advancement of quantum computing
   poses a threat to traditional encryption algorithms. To counter quantum
   computing attacks and enable searches over encrypted keywords,
   lattice-based searchable encryption with conjunctive keyword search has
   been implemented. Nonetheless, existing schemes expose keyword fields
   and leaks additional information. To mitigate this, we propose a
   privacy-preserving method based on lattice hardness assumptions. It
   enables testing the existence of an encrypted keyword in a set of
   encrypted keywords without requiring the keyword fields. Additionally,
   we propose two improved methods: one for inclusion-based searches
   between two keyword sets, and another for range-based keyword searches.
   These form the basis for three lattice-based identity-based searchable
   encryption schemes that support disjunctive, conjunctive, and range
   keyword searches, respectively. The storage overhead of ciphertexts and
   trapdoors is unaffected by the number of keywords, making our scheme
   suitable for multi-keyword search scenarios. Our formal security
   analysis uses the learning with errors (LWE) assumption and our
   theoretical analysis and experimental simulations show comparable
   efficiency and low storage overhead.},

Abstract = {Quantum programming languages (QPL) fill the gap between quantum
   mechanics and classical programming constructions, simplifying the
   development of quantum applications. However, most QPL addresses the
   inherent quantum programming problem, neglecting quantum computer
   implementation constraints. We present a runtime architecture for
   classical-quantum execution that mitigates the limitation of interaction
   between classical and quantum computers originated from the cloud-based
   model of quantum computation provided by several vendors, which implies
   a quantum computer processing in batch. In the proposed runtime
   architecture, we introduce (i) runtime quantum code generation to enable
   generic quantum programming and dynamic quantum execution; and (ii) the
   concept of futures to handle dynamic interaction between classical and
   quantum computers. To support our proposal, we have implemented the Ket
   Quantum Programming framework that features a Python-embedded
   classical-quantum programming language named Ket, the C++ quantum
   programming library Libket, and Ket Bitwise (quantum computing)
   Simulator. The last one improves over the bitwise representation, making
   the simulation time not dependent on the number of qubits but the amount
   of superposition and entanglement of simulation.},

Abstract = {Quantum computers are currently accessible through a cloud-based
   platform that allows users to run their programs on a suite of quantum
   hardware. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and
   utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including
   untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering
   quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance
   points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the
   access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive
   but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper
   with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the
   user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher
   iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering
   of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid
   quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization
   Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of
   approximate to 40\%. To achieve comparable performance with minimal
   parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher
   iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally
   among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a
   mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance
   metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of approximate to 30\%. In
   addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few
   initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and
   an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to
   identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more
   iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement
   of approximate to 45\%.},

Abstract = {Due to the high performance of cloud computing-based microservices, a
   wide range of industries and fields rely on them. In a containerized
   cloud, traditional resource management strategies are typically used to
   allocate and migrate virtual machines. A major problem for cloud service
   providers is resource allocation for containers, which directly affects
   system performance and resource consumption. In this paper, we propose a
   joint optimization of load balancing and resource allocation in the
   cloud using an optimal container management strategy. We aim to enhance
   scheduling efficiency and reduce costs by improving the container's
   schedule requested digitally by users. An improved backtracking search
   optimization (IBSO) algorithm is used to allocate resources between
   end-users/IoT devices and the cloud under the consideration of
   service-level agreements. Mechanic quantum recurrent neural networks
   (MQ-RNNs) are designed to allocate, consolidate, and migrate containers
   in cloud environments. The various simulation measures used to validate
   the proposed strategy are energy consumption, number of active servers,
   number of interruptions, total cost, runtime, and statistical measures.},

Title = {Secure Cloud Storage Based on RLWE Problem},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {27604-27614},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud storage and quantum computing,
   ensuring the integrity of the outsourced data for data owners becomes a
   serious concern. To address this problem, the existing protocols for
   auditing cloud storage are usually based on the post-quantum
   cryptographies to check data integrity. Nevertheless, these protocols
   employ heavy cryptographic operations to construct the data tags, making
   their efficiency low and extensibility poor. In this paper, we take a
   new perspective and explore the possibility of designing secure cloud
   storage (SCS) protocols based on the ring learning with errors problem.
   Instead of matrix variables, our protocol only utilizes vector variables
   to generate data block tags so that it has a much lower computational
   complexity. We then give a strict security proof of cheating resistance
   against the malicious cloud and privacy guarantee against the curious
   third-party auditor. We also extend the proposed protocol to support
   data dynamics and batch auditing for more application scenarios. As a
   further contribution, we summarize a systematic framework for designing
   the lattice-based SCS protocols. Finally, exhaustive performance
   analysis and comparison are provided to verify that the proposed
   protocol outperforms the existing lattice-based SCS protocols in terms
   of both operational efficiency and functional extensibility.},

Abstract = {With the rapid growth of cloud storage and cloud computing services,
   many organizations and users choose to store the data on a cloud server
   for saving costs. However, due to security concerns, data of users would
   be encrypted before sending to the cloud. However, this hinders a
   problem of computation on encrypted data in the cloud, especially in the
   case of performing data matching in various medical scenarios. Public
   key encryption with equality test (PKEET) is a powerful tool that allows
   the authorized cloud server to check whether two ciphertexts are
   generated by the same message. PKEET has then become a promising
   candidate for many practical applications like efficient data management
   on encrypted databases. Lee et al. (Information Sciences 2020) proposed
   a generic construction of PKEET schemes in the standard model and hence
   it is possible to yield the first instantiation of post-quantum PKEET
   schemes based on lattices. At ACISP 2019, Duong et al. proposed a direct
   construction of PKEET over integer lattices in the standard model.
   However, their scheme does not reach the CCA2-security. In this paper,
   we propose an efficient CCA2-secure PKEET scheme based on ideal
   lattices. In addition, we present a modification of the scheme by Duong
   et al. over integer lattices to attain the CCA2-security. Both schemes
   are proven secure in the standard model, and they enjoy the security in
   the upcoming quantum computer era. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Datacenter networks (DCNs) with cloud-edge collaboration are emerging to
   satisfy the communication, computation, and caching (3C) requirements of
   future services such as cloud-based IoT services. However, the enroute
   data over DCNs with cloud-edge collaboration is likely to suffer from
   cyberattacks such as eavesdropping. A large number of services require
   not only 3C resources, but also cryptographic resources for encryption
   to ensure high security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a practical
   approach to provide secret keys for remote users with
   information-theoretic security against attacks from quantum computing. A
   QKD-secured DCN (QKD-DCN) with cloud-edge collaboration can be deployed
   to satisfy the communication, computation, caching, and cryptographic
   (4C) requirements of services. This article innovatively solves the new
   4C resource-allocation (4CRA) problem in the network to minimize the
   cryptographic resource consumption. It formulates an integer linear
   programming (ILP) model and proposes a heuristic cryptographic-dependent
   4CRA algorithm to find optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is
   compared with two baseline 4CRA algorithms which, respectively, consider
   the minimized service delivery latency and the first-fit resource
   availability. Analytical simulations show that the proposed algorithm
   minimizes the key-resource-consumption ratio and the average
   key-resource consumption under static and dynamic traffic scenarios in
   different network topologies.},

Title = {D-NISQ: A reference model for Distributed Noisy Intermediate-Scale
   Quantum computers},

Abstract = {Quantum computing has entered its mature life thanks to the availability
   of cloud-based Noisy Intermediate -Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies.
   These devices allow quantum researchers and practitioners to design,
   develop and test quantum algorithms on actual hardware, paving the way
   toward new approaches in solving problems intractable by classical
   computers. However, in spite of these achievements in quantum
   technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by
   quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and
   the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ
   devices. As a consequence, there is a strong need of introducing
   innovative computing architectures able to interconnect a set of NISQ
   devices to increase the capabilities of current quantum computers of
   solving hard problems in a reliable way. In this paper, the concept of
   Distributed Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (D-NISQ) is introduced as a
   reference computational model by which designing innovative frameworks
   where quantum devices interact to solve a complex problem by working
   cooperatively. In detail, the D-NISQ model consists of a hybrid and
   hierarchical architecture where classical and quantum processors
   interact to iteratively split up a problem into a collection of
   sub-problems, solve each one of them by means of a proper quantum
   algorithm, and fuse output quantum information so as to compute the
   final solution to the problem posed. As demonstrated by two case studies
   based on the well-known Grover's algorithm, a multi-threaded
   implementation of the D-NISQ reference model allows for greater
   reliability in solving problems by quantum computation.},

Abstract = {The learning process of classical machine learning algorithms is tuned
   by hyperparameters that need to be customized to best learn and
   generalize from an input dataset. In recent years, Quantum Machine
   Learning (QML) has been gaining traction as a possible application of
   quantum computing which may provide quantum advantage in the future.
   However, quantum versions of classical machine learning algorithms
   introduce a plethora of additional parameters and circuit variations
   that have their own intricacies in being tuned.
   In this work, we take the first steps towards Automated Quantum Machine
   Learning (AutoQML). We propose a concrete description of the problem,
   and then develop a classical-quantum hybrid cloud architecture that
   allows for parallelized hyperparameter exploration and model training.
   As an application use-case, we train a quantum Generative Adversarial
   neural Network (qGAN) to generate energy prices that follow a known
   historic data distribution. Such a QML model can be used for various
   applications in the energy economics sector.},

Abstract = {Quantum mechanics proposes, universe is a sum of a generic building
   block. Different orientation (i.e., angle, phase, amplitude, etc.) and
   summation of blocks forms entities. When differentiated, building blocks
   used for formation of entity are termed as basis. Following
   computational theory, these basis are termed as computational basis.
   Classical computers possess binary basis. Quantum system possess
   exponential computational power because of infinite computational basis.
   When computing solution to a problem, it's found in state space.
   Deterministic model (Conventional) requires both correct and incorrect
   solution set. For problems of probabilistic nature with plenty of
   variables (NP and P problems), computing solution requires exponential
   time, as entire state space is scanned. Furthermore, if solution is
   incomputable, the computation will never complete as solution is missing
   from both sets. Probabilistic model (Quantum) conducts a guided state
   space search and possess greater information carrying capacity per bit.
   Therefore, Quantum Accelerators (QA) are ideal for solving such
   problems. Resulting implementation of a Generic Quantum Hardware
   Accelerator (GQHA) is described via algorithms, mathematical models and
   microarchitecture. Next, a competitive industrial analysis and virtual
   implementation in a cloud environment is defined. Finally, it's proven
   that GQHA can replace conventional accelerators to produce faster and
   reliable results.},

Abstract = {Modern data centers coordinate hundreds of thousands of heterogeneous
   tasks aiming at providing highly reliable cloud computing services.
   Failure prediction is of vital importance in the analysis of cloud
   reliability. Recently, a novel kernel learning method called relevance
   vector machine (RVM) has been widely applied to solve nonlinear
   predicting problems and has been verified to perform well in many
   situations. However, it remains a great challenge for existing
   approaches to acquire the optimal RVM parameters. In this research, an
   artificial immune system is introduced into a Quantum-inspired Binary
   Gravitational Search Algorithm (QBGSA) in order to improve the
   convergence rate of standard QBGSA. In addition, a hybrid model of RVM
   with improved QBGSA called IQBGSA-RVM is proposed that aims to predict
   the failure time of cloud services. To evaluate the effectiveness of
   IQBGSA-RVM in failure prediction, its predicting performance is compared
   with that of the following algorithms, all of which employs RVM: chaotic
   genetic algorithms, binary gravitational search algorithms, binary
   particle swarm optimization, quantum-inspired binary particle swarm
   optimization and standard QBGSA. The experimental results show that the
   IQBGSA-RVM model is either comparable to the other models or it
   outperforms them, to say the least.},

   Medical Data in Cloud-Assisted WBANs},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},

Pages = {54402-54414},
Abstract = {Data integrity has become an extremely important security issue in
   cloud-assisted wireless body area networks (WBANs). As accurate medical
   diagnostic analysis is heavily based on outsourced electronic medical
   data in cloud storage, any corrupted data may lead to fateful
   consequences. Data auditing contributes to medical data integrity
   verification, but most of existing data auditing schemes are vulnerable
   to attackers equipped with practical quantum-computing devices, which
   are very likely to be invented in the near future. Besides, in many
   scenarios, a patient has no capability to execute medical data integrity
   verification personally, he/she has to specify a verifier to complete
   data auditing. To this end, we present an efficient lattice-based
   designated verifier auditing scheme (LDVAS), which could be well
   deployed in cloud-assisted WBANs. In particular, LDVAS enables a patient
   to designate a unique verifier to execute data auditing in post-quantum
   secure settings, and any others cannot fulfil such task without the
   approval of the patient. We formally prove the security of LDVAS based
   on the hardness assumptions of lattice-based problems. The performance
   evaluation demonstrates the high efficiency and feasibility of LDVAS on
   the side of the designated verifier.},

Abstract = {As cloud computing has developed rapidly, outsourcing data to cloud
   servers for remote storage has become an attractive trend. However, when
   cloud clients store their data in the cloud, the security and privacy of
   cloud data would be threatened due to accidental corruptions or
   purposive attacks caused by a semi-trusted cloud server. The widely used
   method of addressing the security and privacy of cloud data is to store
   encrypted data instead of plain data. As the resulting system is
   unusable, since the cloud can no longer search throughout the data, new
   cryptographic primitive such as public-key encryption with equality test
   (PKEET) has been introduced. PKEET has many interesting applications
   such as keyword search on encrypted data, encrypted data partitioning
   for efficient encrypted data management, personal health record systems,
   spam filtering in encrypted email systems and so forth. PKEET allows
   checking whether two ciphertexts encrypted under different public keys
   contain the same message or not. However, unrestricted access to
   equality tests can reveal information about the underlying data. This is
   not acceptable in respect of users' privacy. In 2015, Ma et al.
   introduce the notion of PKEET with flexible authorization (PKEET-FA)
   which strengthens privacy protection. Since 2015, there are several
   follow-up works on PKEET-FA. However, all are secure in the random
   oracle model and vulnerable to quantum attacks. In this paper, we
   provide two constructions of quantum-safe PKEET-FA secure in the
   standard model based on the hardness assumptions of integer lattices and
   ideal lattices. Finally, we implement the PKEET-FA scheme over ideal
   lattices. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) can be employed to enforce fine grained
   access control over encrypted data. Due to expressiveness, ABE schemes
   are currently employed in cloud computing and storage systems. The
   classical ABE schemes based on bilinear pairing are vulnerable to

Title = {A privacy-preserving multi-factor authentication scheme for
   cloud-assisted IoMT with post-quantum security},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SECURITY AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has found widespread application
   in the healthcare system, leveraging the integration of wireless
   communication and cloud computing to revolutionize modern healthcare
   practices. This paradigm, however, poses security vulnerabilities since
   malicious actors might exploit the public channel to impersonate
   legitimate devices or services and steal sensitive data. Before
   transmitting sensitive information, it is critical to build
   authentication between wearable devices and servers. Despite various
   proposed solutions, present approaches suffer from constraints like as
   sensitivity to quantum attacks and high computation overhead,
   necessitating additional advancement. To address these challenges, this
   article presents a privacy -preserving multi -factor authentication
   scheme with post -quantum security to enhance the security of cloud
   -enable IoMT. The proposed scheme utilizes hash operations and error
   reconciliation technology to provide highly secure and flexible
   authentication suitable for the cloud environment. The scheme's security
   is provable under the Real -Or -Random (ROR) model, meeting common
   security requirements in wireless network. This article also presents a
   thorough comparison of our proposed scheme with state-of-the-art
   methods, showcasing a well-balanced trade-off between security and

Title = {ABAEKS: Attribute-Based Authenticated Encryption With Keyword Search
   Over Outsourced Encrypted Data},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {4970-4983},
Abstract = {The widespread adoption of cloud computing and the exponential growth of
   data highlight the need for secure data sharing and querying.
   Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) has emerged as an efficient means
   of searching encrypted data stored in the cloud. However, existing ABKS
   schemes incur high end-to-end delay and are vulnerable to quantum
   computer attacks and/or (insider) keyword guessing attacks (KGA). To
   address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a new concept
   called attribute-based authenticated encryption with keyword search
   (ABAEKS) and proposes an efficient ABAEKS scheme. Our ABAEKS has low
   end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and
   (insider) KGA. In addition, we formalize the security model of ABAEKS
   system and prove its security in the random oracle model. Finally, we
   conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of ABAEKS, and the
   experimental results show that our ABAEKS is computationally efficient
   and outperforms current state-of-the-art ABKS schemes.},

Title = {DQN-enabled content caching and quantum ant colony-based computation
   offloading in MEC},
Journal = {APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {133},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Computation-intensive and time-delay-sensitive tasks show explosive
   growth, which makes mobile user devices put forward higher requirements
   for such tasks. Mobile user devices are difficult to meet the task
   requirements due to limited computing capacity. To handle this
   situation, a mobile edge computing system requires to be constructed.
   Nevertheless, in the mobile edge computing system, if no popular content
   is cached in the edge server, users will repeatedly send requests to a
   remote cloud data center when requesting content, which will cause delay
   and backhaul link load. To handle this situation, this article plans to
   put forward a content caching policy. In this policy, the caching
   benefit in cache replacement, delay in transmission and backhaul link
   load is taken into account in the content cache. Then DQN is used to
   handle the problem to obtain the optimal content caching scheme. In
   addition, in the mobile edge computing environment, the computing
   capacity of mobile user devices is limited, so task data needs to be
   unloaded to the edge server for local or remote execution to improve the
   computing capacity. To handle the above problems, this article plans to
   put forward a quantum ant colony based computing offloading strategy.
   This strategy takes into account three aspects: delay, energy
   consumption and server cost. Quantum ant colony algorithm is used to
   handle the situation. Experimental results indicate that the content
   caching strategy based on DQN can effectively improve cache hit
   percentage, and cut down transmission delay and return link load.
   Quantum ant colony based computational offloading strategies can
   increase task completion rates, and decrease task completion delays,
   equipment energy consumption and total system cost. (c) 2022 Elsevier

Abstract = {In the dynamic field of quantum computing, characterized by constant
   innovation and continuous advancement of hardware and software
   capabilities, it is clear that this emerging technology holds immense
   potential in fields such as medicine and security. However, as the
   quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of
   challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges
   facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum
   service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of
   managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a
   problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers.
   In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum
   web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This
   solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to
   improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The
   proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates
   tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance,
   and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the
   balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide
   a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated
   through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators
   from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM
   Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average
   reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6\% when
   the load balancer is employed.},

Abstract = {After decades of being mainly confined to theoretical research, Quantum
   Computing is now becoming a useful tool for solving realistic problems.
   This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using
   currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing
   paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection.
   Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely
   connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized
   recommendation by assuming that users within each community share
   similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally
   expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as
   cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to
   explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new
   technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both
   hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing
   the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic
   Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation
   scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is
   able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to
   classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized
   recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved
   recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although
   in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its
   ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved
   scalability as technology evolves.},

Abstract = {We have entered the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Era. A plethora of
   quantum processor prototypes allow evaluation of potential of the
   Quantum Computing paradigm in applications to pressing computational
   problems of the future. Growing data input rates and detector resolution
   foreseen in High-Energy LHC (2030s) experiments expose the often high
   time and/or space complexity of classical algorithms. Quantum algorithms
   can potentially become the lower-complexity alternatives in such cases.
   In this work we discuss the potential of Quantum Associative Memory
   (QuAM) in the context of LHC data triggering. We examine the practical
   limits of storage capacity, as well as store and recall errorless
   efficiency, from the viewpoints of the state-of-the-art IBM quantum
   processors and LHC real-time charged track pattern recognition
   requirements. We present a software prototype implementation of the QuAM
   protocols and analyze the topological limitations for porting the
   simplest QuAM instances to the public IBM 5Q and 14Q cloud-based
   superconducting chips.},

Abstract = {Internet-of-Things(IoT)-based edge computing in smart factories, smart
   grid, agriculture, constructions and autonomous vehicles include
   service-oriented gateways that connect with the cloud, perform
   machine-to-machine communication, often transmiting large amount data up
   and down the network, performing time-sensitive processing and involving
   intelligent local decision-making. In view of a sharp increase in
   cyberattacks today targeting edge computing, these gateways need to
   provide digital signing and key negotiation for ensuring reliable data
   sources, trusted applications and authentic devices and connections. In
   contrast to common perception, we show that post-quantum cryptography
   methods do not necessitate extensive modification to adopt in such
   environments; further, the cryptography algorithm's hardness is
   preserved while fulfilling the IoT device's resource limitations. In
   particular, we demonstrate an efficient method and an implementation on
   a 32-bit ARMCortex-M4, 64KB memory microcontroller, based on
   post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), for secure
   communication and authentication in an industrial IoT environment.},

Abstract = {Asymmetric cryptography plays an essential role in many areas, including
   cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT).
   However, most of them are based on the difficulty of factorizing large
   numbers or discrete logarithm problems, which are not secure to quantum
   computer attacks. SimpleMatrix is a new multivariate encryption scheme
   based on simple matrix multiplications, which can resist quantum
   computer attacks. Because of the low speed and demands of large finite
   fields, SimpleMatrix is limited in applications that use small finite
   fields. As a result, it is critical to improve the efficiency of
   SimpleMatrix to make its applications broader. In this paper, we speed
   up the encryption and decryption of SimpleMatrix by building efficient
   small finite field arithmetics based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays
   (FPGAs) technology. We propose a fast architecture for encryption and
   decryption of SimpleMatrix based on table look-up based composite field
   multiplications and inversions and fast Gauss-Jordan elimination for
   solving systems of linear equations in a composite field. We test and
   verify the hardware architecture of SimpleMatrix on an FPGA, and the
   experimental results confirm our estimates and comparisons show that our
   design is much faster than other implementations. Thus, the hardware
   architecture can be used in FPGA-based systems of cloud computing, IoT,
   etc., for accelerating encryption and decryption.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, companies are more and more adopting cloud technologies in the
   management of their business processes rising, then, the Business
   Process as a Service (BPaaS) model. In order to guarantee the
   consistency of the provisioned BPaaS, cloud providers should ensure a
   strategical management (e.g., allocation, migration, etc.) of their
   available resources (e.g., computation, storage, etc.) according to
   services requirements. Existing researches do not prevent resource
   provision problems before they occur. Rather, they conduct a real-time
   allocation of cloud resources. This paper makes use of historical
   resource usage information for providing enterprises and BPaaS providers
   with predictions of cloud availability zones' states. For that, we first
   propose a Neural Network-based prediction model that exploits the
   superposition power of Quantum Computing and the evolutionary nature of
   the Genetic Algorithm, in order to optimize the accuracy of the
   predicted resource utilization. Second, we define a placement algorithm
   that, based on the prediction results, chooses the optimal cloud
   availability zones for each BPaaS fragment, i.e. under-loaded servers.
   We evaluated our approach using real cloud workload data-sets. The
   obtained results confirmed the effectiveness and the performance of our
   NNQGA approach, compared to traditional techniques.},

Abstract = {As technology advances, it becomes easier to share large amounts of data
   over the internet. Cloud computing is one of the technologies that
   allows for easy data sharing over the internet. It is critical to
   provide security for this data when they are being shared across the
   internet. The security of data saved in cloud storage, as well as data
   transport and transmitting a key required to encrypt data between two
   parties, has been a source of concern for the industry, as a result of
   the growing use of cloud services in recent years. Collective attacks
   are significantly more powerful than individual strikes, according to
   our research. Despite the fact that additional research works were
   studied in the previous literature review, there are some study concerns
   for not correcting third-party data hacking. Therefore, this paper
   focuses on the design of Secured Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with
   Fuzzy logic to improve the security of the shared key. Quantum Key
   Distribution, Post Quantum Key Distribution, and the EPR Proto-col are
   technologies that increase the security of data sharing. We have
   incorporated the Secured Quantum Key Distribution (SQKD) with Fuzzy
   logic in our proposed work to improve the security of the shared key.
   The proposed systems include some additional characteristics in addition
   to the existing approaches. The proposed model uses shifting algorithms
   and the fuzzification procedure to assure the security of the secret key
   in the Fuzzification of Quantum Key approach. The experimental results
   states that the mean value of security losses in SFQ is 1.8306051, and
   the mean value of QKD is 14.6448416, with standard deviations of 1.7329
   and 13.863 for SFQ and QKD, respectively.},

Abstract = {The fog computing concept was proposed to help cloud computing for the
   data processing of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, fog
   computing faces several challenges such as security, privacy, and
   storage. One way to address these challenges is to integrate blockchain
   with fog computing. There are several applications of blockchain-fog
   computing integration that have been proposed, recently, due to their
   lucrative benefits such as enhancing security and privacy. There is a
   need to systematically review and synthesize the literature on this
   topic of blockchain-fog computing integration. The purposes of
   integrating blockchain and fog computing were determined using a
   systematic literature review approach and tailored search criteria
   established from the research questions. In this research, 181 relevant
   papers were found and reviewed. The results showed that the authors
   proposed the combination of blockchain and fog computing for several
   purposes such as security, privacy, access control, and trust
   management. A lack of standards and laws may make it difficult for
   blockchain and fog computing to be integrated in the future,
   particularly in light of newly developed technologies like quantum
   computing and artificial intelligence. The findings of this paper serve
   as a resource for researchers and practitioners of blockchain-fog
   computing integration for future research and designs.},

Abstract = {Quantum Computing has started to demonstrate its first practical
   applications. As the technology develops to a point of maturity that
   allows quantum computers to expand commercially, large companies such as
   Google, Microsoft, IBM and Amazon are making a considerably effort to
   make them accessible through the cloud so that research and industry
   initiatives can test their capabilities. The characteristics of this
   paradigm and the lack of mature tools still make the process of
   defining, implementing, and running quantum, or hybrid classical-quantum
   software systems difficult compared with the procedures used for pure
   classical ones. To address this lack, we present a demonstration of a
   method for defining quantum services and the automatic generation of the
   corresponding source code through an extension of the Open API
   Specification. In this demo we present an extension that enables
   developers to define quantum services with a high abstraction level,
   link them with quantum circuits, and generate the source code of the
   service to be deployed in a quantum computer in the same way they do for
   classical services.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOFTWARE-EVOLUTION AND PROCESS},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, the deployment and
   management of business processes over cloud environments have become an
   essential operation for most enterprises, leading to the emergence of
   BPaaS (Business Process as a Service) as a new cloud service model. This
   SaaS-like service, like its ancestors, should be strategically
   distributed and managed over multiple cloud zones, while taking into
   account several constraints and conditions (e.g., sensitivity of BPaaS
   fragments, insecure and untrusted cloud zones, lack of resources, and
   workload changes). However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which
   means that they are no longer suitable to manage such
   enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain
   and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we
   adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that
   forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as
   hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as
   overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS
   fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network
   prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic
   algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload. QGA-NN is
   evaluated using a BPaaS placement algorithm, which we defined as a
   triggered management operation. Experimental results have proved the
   accuracy and effectiveness of our predictive approach, compared with
   state-of-the-art solutions.},

   Against Keyword Guessing Attacks},
Journal = {IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL},

Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {2101-2112},

Abstract = {Driven by cloud computing technologies, public-key encryption with
   keyword search (PEKS) is becoming a common practice from aspects of the
   Industrial Internet of Things, smart healthcare, vehicular social
   networks, and so on. However, a dozen years of PEKS development is
   accompanied by some security and privacy issues in the encrypted data
   search and access processes. The keyword guessing attack is a typical
   user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user's
   retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the
   emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer
   secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS
   schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger
   key size. To the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum-resist PEKS
   scheme established on elliptic curve cryptography. This article utilizes
   PEKS with designated tester primitive and quantum resistance of isogeny.
   Then, we put forward a postquantum searchable encryption scheme named
   Isoga, which fights against keyword guessing attacks. We prove Isoga's
   searchable ciphertext security and trapdoor indistinguishability under
   isogeny-related difficult assumptions. Performance evaluation indicates
   that the Isoga scheme is more practical in the quantum environment,
   considering seven schemes' security properties, communication cost, and
   computing overload among.},

Abstract = {Network slicing is a powerful tool that provides 5G and future networks
   a robust means for managing cross-application QoS, dynamic traffic
   migration in response to network events, and in-network data aggregation
   and computation. Unfortunately, slicing inherits many of the security
   challenges of cloud and edge computing such as side-channel information
   leakage, while also encountering new challenges posed by multidomain
   authorization and quantum computing. Many extant mechanisms, such as
   PKI, are insufficient in the face of quantum computers, and existing
   side-channel mitigations impose heavy overhead costs while only
   providing defense against known attacks. In this paper, we describe a
   novel approach to protecting slice control information through the use
   of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). HE allows quantum-resilient validation
   and distribution of critical information, while also enabling
   hierarchical control across multiple domains and providing encrypted
   computation. Further, threshold HE enables secure decryption and
   computation of control or measurement information, while protecting the
   entire slice against potential key-leakage by rendering any one key
   useless without the required quorum. The benchmark results shown
   demonstrate that the HE mechanisms used can be deployed in a practical
   manner, providing stalwart security guarantees against a variety of
   threats.},

Abstract = {The Round Robin algorithm is considered as one of the most common
   scheduling algorithms due to its simplicity and fairness. It is applied
   in many fields to improve system performance. In this paper, we
   conducted a review on how the researchers applied the RR algorithm in
   the CPU scheduling as well as in the cloud computing environment. Many
   researchers proposed various techniques in order to improve the RR
   algorithm and selecting the optimal time quantum which plays a vital
   role to enhance this algorithm. This paper presents a review and new
   classification on these techniques. Studies have been classified into
   two categories: RR based on static quantum, and RR based on dynamic
   quantum. Furthermore, the second category was divided into dynamic
   quantum for each round and dynamic quantum for each process. Moreover,
   an analytical comparison has been provided. This review can be a strong
   starting point for researchers who seek to enhance or optimize RR
   algorithm or either apply it in other fields.},

Abstract = {The ability for users to access quantum computers through the cloud has
   increased rapidly in recent years. Despite still being Noisy
   Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines, modern quantum computers are
   now being actively employed for research and by numerous startups.
   Quantum algorithms typically produce probabilistic results,
   necessitating repeated execution to produce the desired outcomes. In
   order for the execution to begin from the specified ground state each
   time and for the results of the prior execution not to interfere with
   the results of the subsequent execution, the reset mechanism must be
   performed between each iteration to effectively reset the qubits.
   However, due to noise and errors in quantum computers and specifically
   these reset mechanisms, a noisy reset operation may lead to systematic
   errors in the overall computation, as well as potential security and
   privacy vulnerabilities of information leakage. To counter this issue,
   we thoroughly examine the state leakage problem in quantum computing,
   and then propose a solution by employing the classical and quantum
   one-time pads before the reset mechanism to prevent the state leakage,
   which works by randomly applying simple gates for each execution of the
   circuit. In addition, this work explores conditions under which the
   classical one-time pad, which uses fewer resources, is sufficient to
   protect state leakage. Finally, we study the role of various errors in
   state leakage, by evaluating the degrees of leakage under different
   error levels of gate, measurement, and sampling errors. Our findings
   offer new perspectives on the design of reset mechanisms and secure
   quantum computing systems.},

Abstract = {With the wide deployment of computing capabilities and artificial
   intelligence (AI) techniques, Internet of intelligence is envisioned as
   a natural tendency in future networks. This technological revolution
   will foster abundant computing services with new requirements, such as
   distributed large AI model training and on-the-fly image rendering,
   which require dynamic collaboration of multi-dimensional resources from
   both the communication and computation perspectives. In this article, we
   introduce a communication and computation integrated network
   architecture, named (Com)(2)Net. Enormous computing traffic can be
   scheduled across space-air-ground domain, end-edge-cloud domain, and
   multi-data center domain, which facilitates ubiquitous connectivity and
   collaborative computation, thus supporting diverse advanced computing
   services. Furthermore, an intelligent resource adaption scheme is
   proposed to dynamically orchestrate multi-dimensional resources for
   massive concurrent computing tasks, in which quantum genetic algorithms
   are utilized to make the best joint decision for inter-domain traffic
   scheduling and intra-domain resource allocation. Finally, we present a
   case study, and discuss open research issues that are fundamental for
   efficient collaborative computation in (Com)(2)Net.},

Abstract = {To overcome the limited communication bandwidth in the deployment of
   command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance,
   and reconnaissance (C4ISR) services, a service deployment platform was
   extended from the cloud to a terminal platform based on the concept of
   fog computing. Additionally, computing and memory resources on the
   terminal platform were used to alleviate the communication pressure due
   to the flow of combat information. A corresponding C4ISR service
   deployment model was constructed, and the quantum evolutionary
   algorithm, the shortest path algorithm, and the pairwise exchange method
   were combined to create a two-level search algorithm. This method can
   plan the operational information flow path and service deployment
   simultaneously, thereby achieving the optimal deployment of services
   even under the constraints of limited communication bandwidth.},

Abstract = {With the advent of cloud computing, more and more consumers prefer to
   use the cloud services with the pay-as-you-consume mode. The cloud
   storage brings about great convenience to users, who store data in cloud
   and access to it using the smart devices anytime and anywhere.
   Consumers' information should be encrypted to guarantee the data
   privacy. Flexible searching on ciphertext is a critical challenge to be
   solved for effective data utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel
   semantic keyword searchable proxy re-encryption scheme for secure cloud
   storage. A highlight of this work is that the scheme is quantum attack
   resistant, while most of the available searchable encryption schemes are
   not. It supports not only exact keyword search but also synonym keyword
   search. Moreover, the data owner is capable to delegate his search right
   to another user using the proxy re-encryption mechanism. In the
   generation process of re-encryption key, the delegator and delegatee do
   not need to be interactive with each other. The scheme is also collusion
   resistant. Under the learning with errors hardness problem, this scheme
   is proved secure in standard model.},

Abstract = {Quantum computers can solve certain problems faster than classical
   computers. The number of quantum computers offered via the cloud
   increases such that a variety is accessible for the public. However,
   current quantum computers still suffer from a small number of qubits and
   high error rates. Selecting a quantum computer providing enough qubits
   and low error rates is tremendously important to receive stable
   execution results for a given quantum circuit. The execution results are
   also influenced by the compilation result of the selected quantum
   compiler for hardware mapping and optimization. For computing time, the
   access is regulated by vendors of quantum computers resulting in waiting
   times for the user. Thus, a deep and manifold analysis of quantum
   computers and compiled circuits of different quantum compilers is
   required to estimate in advance which compiled circuit will return
   stable execution results also in consideration of non-functional
   requirements such as waiting times. To address this, we present a
   framework that analyzes and prioritizes compiled circuits for different
   quantum computers using several compilers based on the requirements of
   the user. We show the practical feasibility of our framework by a
   prototype and two use cases.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in the Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time
   applications, have led to the unprecedented growth in the connected
   devices and their generated data. Traditionally, this sensor data is
   transferred and processed at the cloud, and the control signals are sent
   back to the relevant actuators, as part of the IoT applications. This
   cloud-centric IoT model, resulted in increased latencies and network
   load, and compromised privacy. To address these problems, Fog Computing
   was coined by Cisco in 2012, a decade ago, which utilizes proximal
   computational resources for processing the sensor data. Ever since its
   proposal, fog computing has attracted significant attention and the
   research fraternity focused at addressing different challenges such as
   fog frameworks, simulators, resource management, placement strategies,
   quality of service aspects, fog economics and so forth. However, after a
   decade of research, we still do not see large-scale deployments of
   public/private fog networks, which can be utilized in realizing
   interesting IoT applications. In the literature, we only see pilot case
   studies and small-scale testbeds, and utilization of simulators for
   demonstrating scale of the specified models addressing the respective
   technical challenges. There are several reasons for this, and most
   importantly, fog computing did not present a clear business case for the
   companies and participating individuals yet. This article summarizes the
   technical, non-functional, and economic challenges, which have been
   posing hurdles in adopting fog computing, by consolidating them across
   different clusters. The article also summarizes the relevant academic
   and industrial contributions in addressing these challenges and provides
   future research directions in realizing real-time fog computing
   applications, also considering the emerging trends such as federated
   learning and quantum computing.},

Title = {Toward a Complete Software Stack to Integrate Quantum Key Distribution
   in a Cloud Environment},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {115270-115291},
Abstract = {The coming advent of Quantum Computing promises to jeopardize current
   communications security, undermining the effectiveness of traditional
   public-key based cryptography. Different strategies (Post-Quantum or
   Quantum Cryptography) have been proposed to address this problem. Many
   techniques and algorithms based on quantum phenomena have been presented
   in recent years; the most relevant example is the introduction of
   Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This approach allows to exchange
   cryptographic keys among parties and does not suffer from the
   development of quantum computation. Problems arise when this technique
   has to be deployed and combined with modern distributed infrastructures
   that heavily depend on cloud and virtualisation paradigms. This paper
   addresses the issue by presenting a new software stack that effortlessly
   introduces QKD in such environments. This software stack allows for
   agnostic integration, monitoring, and management of QKD, independent
   from a specific vendor or technology. Furthermore, a QKD simulator is
   presented, designed, and tested. This latter contribution is suitable as
   a low-level testing device, as an independent software module to check
   QKD protocols, and as a testbed to identify future practical
   enhancements.},

Abstract = {The Fifth Generation (5G) mobile broadband standards make a fundamental
   shift in cryptography. Prior generations based their security and
   privacy principally on symmetric key cryptography. The Subscriber
   Identity Module (SIM) and its successors contain a shared key used to
   authenticate the User Equipment (UE) to the network, and vice versa.
   However 5G is shifting its core network over to a microservices,
   cloud-first architecture and is heavily leveraging protocols like TLS
   andOAuth2.0 to authenticate and authorize transactions. As a result, it
   is shifting to a PKI-based trust model. This shift is happening just as
   quantum computing threatens to unravel the security of traditional
   ciphers such as RSA and ECC.
   In this paper we highlight the need to advance the 3GPP 5G standards and
   NIST post-quantum cryptography standards in tandem, with the goal of
   launching a ``quantum ready{''} 5G core network.},

Abstract = {Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) allows computation on encrypted
   data by employing the principles of quantum mechanics. Usually, only one
   evaluator is chosen to complete such computation and it is easy to get
   overburdened in network. In addition, users sometimes do not trust only
   one evalutor. Recently, Chen et al. proposed a very flexible QHE scheme
   based on the idea of (k, n)-threshold quantum state sharing where d
   evaluators can finish the required operations by cooperating together as
   long as k <= d <= n. But it can only calculate some of single-qubit
   unitary operations when k >= 2 and the quantum capability of each
   evaluator is a bit demanding. In this paper, we propose an improved
   flexible QHE scheme which extends the operations that can be computed in
   the QHE scheme proposed by Chen et al. to involve all single-qubit
   unitary operations even if k >= 2 and reduces the quantum capability of
   at least d - 1 evaluators. We also give an example to show the
   feasibility of the improved scheme and simulate it on the IBM's cloud
   quantum computing platform.},

Abstract = {The emergence of new complex technologies, such as cloud and quantum
   computing, has a complicated computational structure, which can
   compromise the security of traditional cryptographic protocols. It has
   been noted that traditional security systems utilize non-quantum
   resistance factorization and Diffie-Hellman (DH) hard problems for their
   protection. Lattice-based cryptography appears to be a potential
   post-quantum substitute for the presently employed public-key
   cryptography. As a result, we have been motivated to focus on
   increasingly sophisticated and challenging lattice hard assumptions
   capable of withstanding new modern technologies with quantum resistance
   properties. In this paper, we devise a new lattice-based public-key
   encryption and signature schemes with smaller key sizes. The proposed
   scheme also resists the quantum attack because of the lattice small
   integer solution problem and its variant. The security claim has also
   been proved in a well-suited model for quantum attacks. The performance
   analysis shows that the presented schemes outperform the DH-type schemes
   and compete with similar lattice-based schemes in terms of storage,
   communication, key sizes, and computational overheads.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of
   companies are adopting cloud storage technology to reduce overhead.
   However, to ensure the privacy of sensitive data, the uploaded data need
   to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. The concept of
   public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) was introduced by Boneh
   et al. to provide flexible usage of the encrypted data. Unfortunately,
   most of the PEKS schemes are not secure against inside keyword guessing
   attacks (IKGA), so the keyword information of the trapdoor may be leaked
   to the adversary. To solve this issue, Huang and Li presented public key
   authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) in which the
   trapdoor generated by the receiver is only valid for authenticated
   ciphertexts. With their seminal work, many PAEKS schemes have been
   introduced for the enhanced security of PAEKS. Some of them further
   consider the upcoming quantum attacks. However, our cryptanalysis
   indicated that in fact, these schemes could not withstand IKGA. To fight
   against the attacks from quantum adversaries and support the
   privacy-preserving search functionality, we first introduce a novel
   generic PAEKS construction in this work. Then, we further present the
   first quantum-resistant PAEKS instantiation based on lattices. The
   security proofs show that our instantiation not only satisfies the basic
   requirements but also achieves enhanced security models, namely the
   multi-ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-trapdoor privacy.
   Furthermore, the comparative results indicate that with only some
   additional expenditure, the proposed instantiation provides more secure
   properties, making it suitable for more diverse application
   environments.},

Abstract = {This work presents a novel Evolutionary Quantum Neural Network (EQNN)
   based workload prediction model for Cloud datacenter. It exploits the
   computational efficiency of quantum computing by encoding workload
   information into qubits and propagating this information through the
   network to estimate the workload or resource demands with enhanced
   accuracy proactively. The rotation and reverse rotation effects of the
   Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gate serve activation function at the hidden and
   output layers to adjust the qubit weights. In addition, a Self Balanced
   Adaptive Differential Evolution (SB-ADE) algorithm is developed to
   optimize qubit network weights. The accuracy of the EQNN prediction
   model is extensively evaluated and compared with seven state-of-the-art
   methods using eight real world benchmark datasets of three different
   categories. Experimental results reveal that the use of the quantum
   approach to evolutionary neural network substantially improves the
   prediction accuracy up to 91.6 percent over the existing approaches.},

Abstract = {Conventional computers have evolved to device components that
   demonstrate failure rates of 10(-17) or less, while current quantum
   computing devices typically exhibit error rates of 10(-2 )or greater.
   This raises concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the
   results obtained from quantum computers. The problem is highlighted by
   experimental observation that today's NISQ devices are inherently
   unstable. Remote quantum cloud servers typically do not provide users
   with an ability to calibrate the device themselves. Using inaccurate
   characterization data for error mitigation can have devastating impact
   on reproducibility. In this study, we investigate if one can infer the
   critical channel parameters dynamically from the noisy binary output of
   the executed quantum circuit and use it to improve program stability. An
   open question however is how well does this methodology scale. We
   discuss the efficacy and efficiency of our adaptive algorithm using
   canonical quantum circuits such as the uniform superposition circuit.
   Our metric of performance is the Hellinger distance between the
   post-stabilization observations and the reference (ideal) distribution.},

Title = {A Quantum-Based Database Query Scheme for Privacy Preservation in Cloud
   Environment},
Journal = {SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Abstract = {Cloud computing is a powerful and popular information technology
   paradigm that enables data service outsourcing and provides higher-level
   services with minimal management effort. However, it is still a key
   challenge to protect data privacy when a user accesses the sensitive
   cloud data. Privacy-preserving database query allows the user to
   retrieve a data item from the cloud database without revealing the
   information of the queried data item, meanwhile limiting user's ability
   to access other ones. In this study, in order to achieve the privacy
   preservation and reduce the communication complexity, a quantum-based
   database query scheme for privacy preservation in cloud environment is
   developed. Specifically, all the data items of the database are firstly
   encrypted by different keys for protecting server's privacy, and in
   order to guarantee the clients' privacy, the server is required to
   transmit all these encrypted data items to the client with the oblivious
   transfer strategy. Besides, two oracle operations, a modified Grover
   iteration, and a special offset encryption mechanism are combined
   together to ensure that the client can correctly query the desirable
   data item. Finally, performance evaluation is conducted to validate the
   correctness, privacy, and efficiency of our proposed scheme.},

Abstract = {Open source software (OSS) can be used for the development of geospatial
   database in cloud computing environment. Open source GIS (OSGIS) yields
   strong spatial solutions in a cost-effective manner and used for work
   connected to geospatial database creation, geospatial Web services,
   geospatial database storage, etc. The present work critically analyzes
   two popular OSGIS software i.e., Quantum GIS and Map Window GIS for
   geospatial database creation to give better comprehension of procedure
   and execution in education sector with cloud SDI. Presently, geospatial
   database provides detailed information about the entire technical
   institute of Odisha in test case. The objective is to deliver spatial
   statistics at reasonable costs and anticipated to be advantageous for
   stake holders such as students, parents, faculty members, government
   organizations. The same may be scaled up in future for technical
   institutes of other states in India.},

Abstract = {Cloud hosting of quantum machine learning (QML) models exposes them to a
   range of vulnerabilities, the most significant of which is the model
   stealing attack. In this study, we assess the efficacy of such attacks
   in the realm of quantum computing. Our findings revealed that model
   stealing attacks can produce clone models achieving up to 0.9x and 0.99x
   clone test accuracy when trained using Top-1 and Top-k labels,
   respectively (k : num\_classes). To defend against these attacks, we
   propose: 1) hardware variation-induced perturbation (HVIP) and 2)
   hardware and architecture variation-induced perturbation (HAVIP).
   Despite limited success with our defense techniques, it has led to an
   important discovery: QML models trained on noisy hardwares are naturally
   resistant to perturbation or obfuscation-based defenses or attacks.},

Title = {On the Possibility of Classical Client Blind Quantum Computing},
Journal = {CRYPTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Classical client remote state preparation (CC - RSP) is a primitive
   where a fully classical party (client) can instruct the preparation of a
   sequence of random quantum states on some distant party (server) in a
   way that the description is known to the client but remains hidden from
   the server. This primitive has many applications, most prominently, it
   makes blind quantum computing possible for classical clients. In this
   work, we give a protocol for classical client remote state preparation,
   that requires minimal resources. The protocol is proven secure against
   honest-but-curious servers and any malicious third party in a game-based
   security framework. We provide an instantiation of a trapdoor
   (approximately) 2-regular family of functions whose security is based on
   the hardness of the Learning-With-Errors problem, including a first
   analysis of the set of usable parameters. We also run an experimentation
   on IBM's quantum cloud using a toy function. This is the first
   proof-of-principle experiment of classical client remote state
   preparation.},

Abstract = {For a specific quantum chip, multi-programming improves overall
   throughput and resource utilization. Previous studies on mapping
   multiple programs often lead to resource under-utilization, high error

   mapping quantum programs in the cloud environment. We have three new
   designs in QuCloud. (1) We leverage the community detection technique to
   partition physical qubits among concurrent quantum programs, avoiding
   the waste of robust resources. (2) We design X-SWAP scheme that enables
   inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated with critical gates
   to reduce the SWAP overheads. (3) We propose a compilation task
   scheduler that schedules concurrent quantum programs to be compiled and
   executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. We evaluate
   our work on publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated
   quantum chip IBMQ50. Our work outperforms the state-of-the-art work for
   multi-programming on fidelity and compilation overheads by 9.7\% and

Abstract = {In order to reduce the positioning error of wireless sensor network
   nodes and deal with the positioning of a large number of sensor network
   nodes, a mass sensor node positioning method based on particle swarm
   optimization (SNPSO) is proposed. The node location error of node
   distance correction value is corrected by SNPSO algorithm, and the
   sensing data is encoded by the index of cloud computing resources. The
   dynamic target strategy (DTS) algorithm is used to solve the strict
   deadline constraints. The algorithm focuses on optimizing execution time
   to meet deadline constraints, and once feasible solutions are obtained,
   it focuses on optimizing execution costs within deadline constraints.
   The performance of the algorithm is simulated and analyzed on the
   platform of MATLAB 2016. Compared with the sensor positioning method,
   SNPSO improves the positioning accuracy of mass sensor nodes. The
   simulation results verify the validity of SNPSO. Compared with the
   improved quantum genetic algorithm (IQGA) under different scale data
   scheduling and different deadlines constraints, the proposed algorithm
   can improve the positioning accuracy of mass sensor nodes. The proposed
   algorithm can find the optimal solution of cloud computing resource
   scheduling with lower execution cost under strict deadline constraints,
   and can more easily meet the needs of massive sensor network node
   location data processing.},

Abstract = {With the increasing use of big data, cloud computing, and machine
   learning in high-stake domains such as justice systems, financial
   institutions, and healthcare, concerns about fairness have become more
   prominent. This paper presents a novel approach to foster fair
   decision-making by tackling social bias and enhancing transparency in
   machine learning models. The proposed framework leverages
   quantum-inspired complex-valued neural networks and attention-based
   networks, offering improved transparency in modeling the decision
   process for interpreting feature importance and dependency. Furthermore,
   our approach tackles the challenges posed by imbalanced data through the
   incorporation of focal loss and oversampling techniques, resulting in
   reduced prediction errors. Through extensive experiments conducted on
   real-life datasets encompassing criminal charge prediction, financial
   fraud detection, and credit card default payment prediction, our
   approach consistently demonstrates reliable prediction precision and
   recall. Notably, our analysis of feature significance highlights the
   statistical importance of task-related features such as historical
   records of bank transactions or criminal charge history, while socially
   biased identifiers like race, gender, and age exhibit minimal
   significance. By excluding these biased features, our approach enhances
   fairness without compromising prediction accuracy, thereby contributing
   to the advancement of fair decision-making in big data and cloud
   computing across various high-stake domains.},

Abstract = {Edge computing brings data computation and storage closer to the mobile
   device to save response time for decision making. After being processed
   at the edge, commonly the data will be uploaded to the cloud for further
   enriched analysis. For privacy concerns, local devices may encrypt the
   collected data before sending it to the cloud server. However, this
   treatment increases the server's processing time and makes it hard to
   pick out the desired data. In this article, to address this problem, we
   design an encrypted data validation scheme, which enables the edge to
   clean the encrypted data to be uploaded. Because edge computing
   encompasses numerous edge devices from different service providers, we
   explore the public-key cryptographic mechanism to implement our secure
   data validation scheme. Considering potential risks from quantum
   computers, we propose to leverage ideal lattice to realize our protocol,
   which reaches better performance in both time and storage for edge
   devices. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed proposal
   achieves considerable performance improvements in terms of communication
   and computation aspects. Particularly, compared to prior work, nearly
   123x-238x speed up is achieved in our key derivation procedure and the
   storage cost of the secret key is reduced from 547MB to 1.7MB.},

   Multi-User Setting},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {75965-75982},
Abstract = {Spectral clustering, a powerful algorithm in the field of AI, holds a
   significant role despite its inherent high time complexity. For data
   owners grappling with limitations such as small datasets and restricted
   computational resources, harnessing the computational capabilities of
   cloud computing and aggregating data from multiple sources can yield
   precise spectral clustering results. However, explicit data uploading to
   cloud servers poses privacy risks. In response to this challenge, we
   explore the outsourcing dilemma of spectral clustering in a cloud and
   multi-user environment and propose a quantum-secure and efficient
   solution. Specifically, by employing the CKKS homomorphic encryption
   algorithm within a dual non-collusive server model, we formulate a
   comprehensive and multi-user spectral clustering outsourcing scheme. Our
   approach addresses privacy concerns by introducing secure computation
   protocols for L-2 norm, exponential function, and negative half power
   function. We elaborate on efficient computational algorithms for each
   stage of spectral clustering, ensuring accurate clustering outcomes
   without compromising dataset privacy. Moreover, in our scheme, users
   only need to upload their encrypted dataset without requiring direct
   interaction with each other or the cloud server until obtaining
   clustering results. Finally, we argue the IND-CPA security of our design
   and substantiate its accuracy and efficiency through theoretical
   comparison analysis and experimental evaluations.},

Title = {FACVO-DNFN: Deep learning-based feature fusion and Distributed Denial of
   Service attack detection in cloud computing},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {261},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Cloud computing offers a broad range of resource pools for conserving a
   huge quantity of information. Due to the intrusion of attackers, the
   information that exists in the cloud is threatened. Distributed Denial
   of Service (DDoS) attack is the main reason for attacks in the cloud. In
   this study, a Fractional Anti Corona Virus Optimization-based Deep
   Neuro-Fuzzy Network (FACVO-based DNFN) is devised for detecting DDoS in
   the cloud. The production of log files, feature fusion, data
   augmentation, and DDoS attack detection is the processing stages
   involved in this phase of the DDoS attack detection process. The feature
   fusion is carried out by RV coefficient and Deep Quantum Neural Network
   (Deep QNN), and the data augmentation is performed. Then, the Anti
   Corona Virus Optimization (ACVO) method and Fractional Calculus (FC) are
   both incorporated to create the FACVO algorithm. The DNFN is trained by
   the created FACVO algorithm, which identifies the DDoS attack. The
   proposed approach achieved testing accuracy, TPR, TNR, and precision
   values of 0.9304, 0.9088, 0.9293, and 0.8745 for using the NSL-KDD
   dataset without attack, and 0.9200, 0.8991, 0.9015, and 0.8648 for using
   the BoT-IoT dataset without attack.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {FS-IBEKS: Forward secure identity-based encryption with keyword search
   from lattice},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Public Key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) makes it possible for a
   cloud server (CS) to match a trapdoor and a ciphertext. However, with
   the upgrowth of quantum techniques, most of the existing PEKS schemes
   will be broken by quantum computers in the coming future. Moreover, they
   are also under the threat of potential key exposure. Lattice-based
   forward secure PEKS scheme (FS-PEKS) overcomes the two problems above by
   combining the techniques of forward security and lattice-based
   cryptography. However, FS-PEKS schemes work in public key infrastructure
   (PKI), which will incur complicated certificate management procedures.
   In this work, to overcome the key management issue but still guarantee
   security even when attackers corrupt the keys, we extend the FS-PEKS
   scheme into the identity-based framework and present a forward secure
   identity-based encryption with keyword search (FS-IBEKS) scheme from
   lattice. The proposed scheme is secured under the selective identity
   against chosen plaintext attack (IND-sID-CPA) in the random oracle
   model. To further improve the security, we present another FS-IBEKS
   scheme into the standard model and give concrete security proof under
   the adaptive identity against chosen plaintext attack (IND-ID-CPA). The
   comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that our FS-IBEKS
   schemes are feasible for cloud computing.},

Abstract = {Identity-based signature schemes enable any pair of users to communicate
   securely and to verify each other's identity without exchanging private
   or public keys, without keeping key directories, and without using the
   services of a third party. Such paradigms are very suitable for an
   emerging scenario of Multimedia Social Networks (MSNs), in which there
   are a large number of users, dynamic interaction and huge content
   sharing. A revocable identity-based signature(RIBS) scheme, proposed by
   Tsai et al., provides a revocation mechanism for controlling user's
   access dynamically. To capture a realistic and efficient scenario, In
   2017, XiaoYing Jia et al. introduced an additional important component,
   called Cloud Revocation Server(CRS), where most of the computations
   needed during key-updates are of loaded to the CRS. With the surprising
   development of quantum computation technology in recent years, IBS
   schemes mentioned above, based on conventional number theory problem,
   would become vulnerable. Recently, lattice-based cryptography schemes
   were proved to be secure against quantum attacks. Although such
   efficient RIBS scheme based on Computational Diffle-Hellam Problem(CDH)
   assumption has been proposed, all the lattice-based RIBS do not achieve
   this realistic and efficient property. In this paper, we propose the
   first lattice-based RIBS with outsourced Cloud Service Provider(CSP). In
   our scheme, a user's private key is composed of both an partial private
   key and a time update key. The time update key is periodically updated
   by CSP and is transmitted over a public channel. Based on the hardness
   assumption of Short Integer Solution (SIS), we demonstrate that the
   proposed lattice-based RIBS scheme with outsourced revocation in cloud
   computing provides existential unforgeability against adaptive
   chosen-message attacks in the random oracle. As compared to the existing
   IBS schemes over lattices, our RIBS scheme has better performance in
   terms of energy consumption, signature size, signing key size, and the
   revocation mechanism with public channels. As the underlying lattice
   problem is intractable even for quantum computers, our scheme would work
   well in the quantum age.},

Abstract = {Searchable encryption enables secure searches over encrypted data in the
   cloud. Among all paradigms, public key encryption with keyword search
   (PEKS) is particularly desirable by privacy-preserving distributed
   computing and IoT applications, since it allows multiple parties (i.e.,
   writers) to independently contribute encrypted data. However, a PEKS
   search usually requires a linear scan over the entire dataset for
   keyword search, causing unacceptable latency when facing a large amount
   of data. All existing efforts to speed up multi-writer searchable
   encryption are based on conventional hardness assumptions for security,
   which can be broken provided the advent of quantum computers.
   In this work, we propose a lattice-based multi-writer searchable
   encryption scheme, which lets writers build indices for their outsourced
   data to make keyword searches faster. Meanwhile, the security of the
   proposed solution relies on the learning with errors assumption, which
   is known to withstand the potential attack from quantum computers.},

Title = {RLWE-Based ID-DIA Protocols for Cloud Storage},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {55732-55743},
Abstract = {To ensure the integrity of cloud storage, it is necessary for data
   owners to launch data integrity auditing (DIA) periodically. To fit more
   application scenarios, the research direction is shifted to design
   identity-based DIA (ID-DIA) protocols without expensive public key
   infrastructure, which can resist the quantum computing attacks
   simultaneously. However, the existing ID-DIA protocols are usually based
   on heavy anti-quantum computing cryptographies, which might severely
   limit their practical deployments. To address this problem, we explore
   three ways to design RLWE-based ID-DIA (ID-DIA-RLWE) protocols. The
   first is to improve the existing LWE-based ID-DIA protocols. The second
   is to enhance the existing RLWE-based DIA protocols. The third is to
   instantiate the proposed semantic ID-DIA protocol. Among these three
   proposed protocols, the third one is the most efficient due to its
   simplest construction. We also propose a new security model of ID-DIA
   protocols, including correctness assurance, security guarantee, and
   privacy protection. Then, we provide theoretical analysis of all
   proposed ID-DIA protocols under the given security model. Finally, we
   conduct extensive performance evaluation and comparison, which further
   validate that the third protocol has superiority in the perspectives of
   computation, communication, and storage costs.},

Abstract = {The integrity auditing of outsourced data is becoming an essential
   process because an increasing number of people or organizations are
   opting to store health records in cloud servers to reduce local storage.
   Most existing public auditing schemes requiring complex certificate
   management are unsuitable for resource-limited mobile devices and are
   unable to resist quantum attacks; thus, we propose a lattice-based
   proxy-oriented public auditing scheme for electronic health records. We
   construct an identity-based auditing scheme based on the small integer
   solution to avoid complex certificate management issues. We also
   introduce the idea of proxy to reduce computing overhead from the user
   side significantly and enable the application of resource-limited mobile
   devices. Furthermore, we improve the proposed scheme by integrating the
   Ethereum blockchain to resist malicious proxies. We prove that the
   proposed scheme is proxy-protected, unforgeable, and privacy-protected.
   Results of an efficiency analysis show that our scheme demonstrates high
   computing efficiency on the user side and comprehensive functions.},

Abstract = {Dempster rule of combination is a powerful combination tool. It has been
   widely used in many fields, such as information fusion and
   decision-making. However, the computational complexity of Dempster rule
   of combination increases exponentially with the increase of frame of
   discernment. To address this issue, leveraging the parallel advantage of
   quantum computing, we present a quantum algorithm of Dempster rule of
   combination. The new method includes four steps. First, the quantum
   superposition states corresponding to arbitrary mass functions are
   prepared. Next, the superposition states corresponding to the two mass
   functions are combined by the tensor product. Effective qubits are then
   measured. Finally, the measurement results are normalized to obtain the
   combined results. The new method not only realizes most of the functions
   of Dempster rule of combination, but also effectively reduces the
   computational complexity of Dempster rule of combination in the quantum
   computer. Finally, we carry out the simulation experiments on the
   quantum cloud platform of IBM, and the experimental results show that
   the new method is reasonable. Compared with the traditional combination
   rule, this method effectively reduces the computational complexity. As
   the frame of discernment becomes larger, the advantages of the proposed
   approach in terms of running time become larger and larger.},

Abstract = {Multicontrolled unitary gates have been a subject of interest in quantum
   computing since their conception and are widely used in quantum
   algorithms. The current state-of-the-art approach to implementing n
   -qubit multicontrolled gates with a single target without relying on
   auxiliary qubits or approximate results involves the use of a quadratic
   number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. However, linear solutions are
   possible for the case where the controlled gate is special unitary,
   SU(2). The decomposition of an n -qubit multicontrolled SU(2) gate
   requires a circuit with a number of CNOT gates proportional to 28n . In
   this work, we present a new decomposition of n -qubit multicontrolled
   SU(2) gates that require a circuit with a number of CNOT gates
   proportional to 20n and proportional to 16n if the SU(2) gate has at
   least one real-valued diagonal. The proposed algorithms produce the most
   efficient known circuits and improve the existing algorithm by reducing
   the number of CNOT gates and the overall circuit depth. As an
   application, we show the use of this decomposition for sparse quantum
   state preparation. Our results are further validated by demonstrating a
   proof of principle on a quantum device accessed through quantum cloud
   services.},

Abstract = {Software-Intensive Systems are applications that use a high amount of
   computational resources for the execution of complex tasks in which a
   constant flow of information is needed. In the current conception of the
   computing continuum, such computational resources are spread in the
   infrastructure from the Cloud to the Edge and the tasks are mapped on
   resources following placing and replacing strategies. In this scope,
   this paper puts together two emergent paradigms. On the one hand, the
   emergence of the Quantum Computation paradigm will allow these intensive
   systems to incorporate specific tasks that are unaffordable by classic
   computers. On the other hand, the liquid software model proposes a fluid
   movement of the software and information from one device to another.
   Therefore, in this paper, we present a broad overview of
   software-intensive systems from a liquid software perspective and
   support quantum functionalities in their processes. To provide a better
   understanding of how these systems can take form, we explore a case
   study based on weather forecasts.},

Abstract = {To cope with the local storage stress that has resulted from the
   increase in data volumes and to keep data privacy, users outsource their
   data to cloud servers after encrypting these data. Public key encryption
   with keyword search (PEKS) is a technique that can achieve the search
   function on encrypted data. However, most existing PEKS schemes are
   based on bilinear pairing which will be broken under the quantum
   computing attack. Moreover, the traditional PEKS schemes have an
   inherent security issue: They cannot resist the keywords guessing attack
   (KGA) which can cause devastating damage to the encrypted database. To
   address these problems, this paper proposes a KGA-resistance encrypted
   search scheme on lattice that is post-quantum secure. Furthermore, to
   achieve rich queries, our scheme is also designed to support the
   conjunctive query. Finally, the security analysis and performance
   evaluation are presented, which demonstrates that our scheme realizes a
   good balance between security and efficiency compared with related
   works.},

Title = {Joint optimization of low-carbon product family configuration and smart
   production line selection},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {182},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {To meet the requirements of small batch orders and rapid production,
   many enterprises began to use robots, artificial intelligence, cloud
   computing, and other new technologies to construct smart production
   lines, which are high-flexible and capable of autonomously diagnosing
   their health and autonomously designing continuous improvement projects.
   In this study, a joint optimization model is established for
   concurrently determining the optimal product family configuration and
   the optimal construction plan for a smart production line. Greenhouse
   gas emissions are considered in the joint optimization model to realize
   the low-carbon design concept. A quantum evolutionary algorithm and a
   genetic algorithm are developed to solve the established optimization
   model. A case study of the electronic dictionary product family is
   provided to illustrate the proposed method. The numeric experiments show
   that the proposed model can reap more profit from a systematic
   perspective compared with the traditional two-stage approach, and the
   proposed quantum evolutionary algorithm has a good performance in
   solving the joint optimization problem.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) are the group of medical devices
   connected to Internet, to perform the processes and services that
   support healthcare. The amount of data handled by medical devices grows
   exponentially, which means higher exposure of personal sensitive data.
   RSA, ECC and, other related public key cryptographic systems with
   countermeasures of power analysis and fault analysis, e.g., random
   masking, are often adapted by medical devices for guaranteing security
   and privacy. However, Shor algorithm has proven that they are not secure
   to quantum computer attacks. Fortunately, there exists a few
   quantum-resistant public key cryptographic schemes, e.g., Rainbow. To
   ensure end-to-end service delivery in the IoMTs under quantum attacks,
   there is a critical need for research into new designs and evaluation
   for the hardware security of new quantum-resistance cryptographic
   systems, e.g., rainbow, to make the medical devices more secure and
   reliable. Therefore, we present a physical analysis model of Rainbow by
   combining fault analysis and differential power analysis. The proposed
   model is implemented on cloud computing platform. Based on the
   experimental results, we successfully recover all the secret keys of
   Rainbow signature, which shows the importance of protecting multivariate
   signature with countermeasures on medical devices.},

Title = {Easy to integrate API for accessing true random numbers generated with
   IDQ's Quantis Appliance},
Journal = {SOFTWAREX},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Generating quality random numbers is essential for many computer
   applications, from preserving data privacy through cryptography and
   federated learning to artificial intelligence and machine learning. The
   role of random numbers in such applications is to add the necessary
   entropy to produce secure keys that protect data, to select data for
   training and testing machine learning models, or to improve the
   efficiency of solution space searches in evolutionary algorithms and
   heuristic methods. The available software methods can only generate
   pseudo-random numbers, while conventional hardware methods extract
   randomness from the environment, and these physical processes possess
   specific self-similar patterns. In contrast, quantum random number
   generators (QRNGs) produce truly random numbers by exploiting the
   randomness of quantum state measurement. Software platforms that provide
   random numbers over the cloud, rendered with network- attached quantum
   random number generator devices, exist; however, they were not developed
   as a native C language solution for embedded applications. Therefore, we
   introduce libqrng, written in C, which offers access to IDQ's Quantis
   Appliance high-quality random numbers through an easy-to-integrate API
   for embedded and distributed computing applications that requires
   randomness and an interface for using the library from different

Title = {Hybrid computing framework security in dynamic offloading for
   IoT-enabled smart home system},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Month = {AUG 23},
Abstract = {In the distributed computing era, cloud computing has completely changed
   organizational operations by facilitating simple access to resources.
   However, the rapid development of the IoT has led to collaborative
   computing, which raises scalability and security challenges. To fully
   realize the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in smart home
   technologies, there is still a need for strong data security solutions,
   which are essential in dynamic offloading in conjunction with edge, fog,
   and cloud computing. This research on smart home challenges covers
   in-depth examinations of data security, privacy, processing speed,
   storage capacity restrictions, and analytics inside networked IoT
   devices. We introduce the Trusted IoT Big Data Analytics (TIBDA)
   framework as a comprehensive solution to reshape smart living. Our
   primary focus is mitigating pervasive data security and privacy issues.
   TIBDA incorporates robust trust mechanisms, prioritizing data privacy
   and reliability for secure processing and user information
   confidentiality within the smart home environment. We achieve this by
   employing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines Elliptic Curve
   Cryptography (ECC), Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), and Blockchain
   technology (BCT) to protect user privacy and confidentiality.
   Additionally, we comprehensively compared four prominent Artificial
   Intelligence anomaly detection algorithms (Isolation Forest, Local
   Outlier Factor, One-Class SVM, and Elliptic Envelope). We utilized
   machine learning classification algorithms (random forest, k-nearest
   neighbors, support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and
   quadratic discriminant analysis) for detecting malicious and
   non-malicious activities in smart home systems. Furthermore, the main
   part of the research is with the help of an artificial neural network
   (ANN) dynamic algorithm; the TIBDA framework designs a hybrid computing
   system that integrates edge, fog, and cloud architecture and efficiently
   supports numerous users while processing data from IoT devices in
   real-time. The analysis shows that TIBDA outperforms these systems
   significantly across various metrics. In terms of response time, TIBDA
   demonstrated a reduction of 10-20\% compared to the other systems under
   varying user loads, device counts, and transaction volumes. Regarding
   security, TIBDA's AUC values were consistently higher by 5-15\%,
   indicating superior protection against threats. Additionally, TIBDA
   exhibited the highest trustworthiness with an uptime percentage 10-12\%
   greater than its competitors. TIBDA's Isolation Forest algorithm
   achieved an accuracy of 99.30\%, and the random forest algorithm
   achieved an accuracy of 94.70\%, outperforming other methods by 8-11\%.
   Furthermore, our ANN- based offloading decision-making model achieved a
   validation accuracy of 99\% and reduced loss to 0.11, demonstrating
   significant improvements in resource utilization and system performance.},

   the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPABE) into the CFS.
   To improve the performance of CP-ABE, we make use of an optimization
   method to convert the ABAC/XACML policy into a Small Policy Matrix
   (SPM). We further prove that this matrix has small coefficients and
   generates an all-one reconstruction vector, such that it reduces the
   cumulative error in lattice cryptosystem to the minimum. By using the
   SPM, we design a new CP-ABE scheme from Lattice (CP-ABE-L) to prevent
   the enlargement of error bounds. We also give the optimal estimation of
   system parameters, which satisfy three lattice-generation conditions to
   implement a valid Error Proportion Allocation (EPA). Our scheme is
   proved secure against chosen-plaintext attack with a selective attribute
   set under the Decision Learning with Errors (DLWE) assumption in the
   standard model. The performance evaluation and analyses illustrate that
   our scheme not only has short parameters, but also maintains efficient
   computation and reasonable storage overloads.

Abstract = {Human microarray gene profile analysis has become popular for early
   cancer detection. Due to security risks, Healthcare 4.0 standards make
   processing patient gene data difficult. Healthcare 4.0 guidelines must
   secure gene profile data storage and exchange. Recently several
   blockchain-based methods have been proposed for secure data processing
   for Cloud-based Healthcare 4.0 architecture. However, existing solutions
   not providing all the essential features like scalability, strong
   security measures, computational efficiency, and multiple security
   parameters. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel approach for
   the secure processing of the microarray gene expression data using
   computationally efficient, scalable, and highly secured Healthcare 4.0
   standards. We propose a new Healthcare 4.0 architecture based on
   lightweight cryptography and blockchain technologies. Blockchain
   technology's recent advancements in cloud data storage and sharing
   indicate potential security features. Smart healthcare applications need
   a centralized approach for safe data storage and exchange. Edge layer
   (patients/gene users), fog, cloud storage, and blockchain make up
   Healthcare 4.0. Fog nodes store and search edge-layer gene data in
   blockchain-enabled cloud storage using lightweight cryptography.
   Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) protects data processing and privacy
   using Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) and Elliptic Curve Digital
   Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). Meta-data from cloud-saved data is stored
   in blockchain to prevent tampering, forging, and quantum. We designed
   different threat-based case studies to demonstrate the model's
   efficiency and scalability. Computing efficiency and security are better
   with the proposed strategy. The outcome case studies showed that the
   suggested approach protected against various opponent models. The
   proposed method reduces encryption and decryption times by 325 and 20
   ms, respectively.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and
   smart devices in several domains embracing healthcare, Industry 4.0,
   transportation and agriculture are giving rise to a prodigious amount of
   data requiring ever-increasing computations and services from cloud to
   the edge of the network. Fog/Edge computing is a promising and
   distributed computing paradigm that has drawn extensive attention from
   both industry and academia. The infrastructural efficiency of these
   computing paradigms necessitates adaptive resource management mechanisms
   for offloading decisions and efficient scheduling. Resource Management
   (RM) is a non-trivial issue whose complexity is the result of
   heterogeneous resources, incoming transactional workload, edge node
   discovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters at the same time,
   which makes the efficacy of resources even more challenging. Hence, the
   researchers have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques
   to resolve the above-mentioned issues. This paper offers a comprehensive
   review of resource management issues and challenges in Fog/Edge paradigm
   by categorizing them into provisioning of computing resources, task
   offloading, resource scheduling, service placement, and load balancing.
   In addition, existing AI and non-AI based state-of-the-art solutions
   have been discussed, along with their QoS metrics, datasets analysed,
   limitations and challenges. The survey provides mathematical formulation
   corresponding to each categorized resource management issue. Our work
   sheds light on promising research directions on cutting-edge
   technologies such as Serverless computing, 5G, Industrial IoT (IIoT),
   blockchain, digital twins, quantum computing, and Software-Defined
   Networking (SDN), which can be integrated with the existing frameworks
   of fog/edge-of-things paradigms to improve business intelligence and
   analytics amongst IoT-based applications.},

Title = {A novel hybrid of Shortest job first and round Robin with dynamic
   variable quantum time task scheduling technique},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLOUD COMPUTING-ADVANCES SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {6},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Cloud computing is a ubiquitous network access model to a shared pool of
   configurable computing resources where available resources must be
   checked and scheduled using an efficient task scheduler to be assigned
   to clients. Most of the existing task schedulers, did not achieve the
   required standards and requirements as some of them only concentrated on
   waiting time or response time reduction or even both neglecting the
   starved processes at all. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid task
   scheduling algorithm named (SRDQ) combining Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and
   Round Robin (RR) schedulers considering a dynamic variable task quantum.
   The proposed algorithms mainly relies on two basic keys the first having
   a dynamic task quantum to balance waiting time between short and long
   tasks while the second involves splitting the ready queue into two
   sub-queues, Q1 for the short tasks and the other for the long ones.
   Assigning tasks to resources from Q(1) or Q(2) are done mutually two
   tasks from Q(1) and one task from Q(2). For evaluation purpose, three
   different datasets were utilized during the algorithm simulation
   conducted using CloudSim environment toolkit 3.0.3 against three
   different scheduling algorithms SJF, RR and Time Slice Priority Based RR
   (TSPBRR) Experimentations results and tests indicated the superiority of
   the proposed algorithm over the state of art in reducing waiting time,
   response time and partially the starvation of long tasks.},

Title = {Performance of New Hope and CRYSTALS-Dilithium Postquantum Schemes in
   the Transport Layer Security Protocol},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {213968-213980},
Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a notable amount of research on
   developing cryptographic schemes that are secure against both quantum
   and classical computers. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards
   and Technology (NIST) initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and
   standardize one or more quantum-resistant public key cryptographic
   schemes. This process originated because quantum computers can exploit
   quantum mechanical phenomena and solve mathematical problems that are
   difficult or intractable for classical computers. This kind of
   mathematical problem is the basis of secure public key cryptography. As
   a consequence, in a near future quantum computers will be able to break
   many of the public key schemes currently in use. However, the challenge
   is especially acute for devices with different architectures. They might
   not be well equipped to run the new standards and interoperate with
   existing communication protocols and networks. In this work, we analyze
   the performance of postquantum schemes in the transport layer security
   (TLS) protocol considering x86 as the server architecture and x86/ARM
   architectures as clients. All of them lack cloud computing or
   virtualized environments. Our analysis considers integrating the
   implementation of two cryptographic schemes that were successful in the
   second round of the postquantum standardization process, namely,
   Dilithium and New Hope. The performance of postquantum schemes in the
   TLS protocol is statistically analyzed in x86 and ARM architectures,
   giving the relationships, the effects and the survival of the analysis.},

Abstract = {The Transient Public Key Infrastructure or T-PKI is introduced in this
   paper that allows a transactional approach to attestation, where a
   Trusted Platform Module (TPM) can stay anonymous to a verifier. In cloud
   computing and IoT environments, attestation is a critical step in
   ensuring that the environment is untampered with. With attestation, the
   verifier would be able to ascertain information about the TPM (such as
   location, or other system information) that one may not want to
   disclose. The addition of the Direct Anonymous Attestation added to TPM
   2.0 would potentially solve this problem, but it uses the traditional
   RSA or ECC based methods. In this paper, a Lattice-based approach is
   used that is both quantum safe, and not dependent on creating a new key
   pair in order to increase anonymity.},

Abstract = {Proxy re-encryption (PRE) can share ciphertext data without leaking the
   decryption key of the data owner in cloud computing. Because of the
   special property, PRE achieves good reliability and secrecy.
   Nevertheless, most of the proposed proxy re-encryption schemes are based
   on the number theoretic problem and cannot resist quantum attacks. In
   addition, most existing researches over lattice focus on the single bit
   encryption, which leads to low efficiency. Therefore, according to these
   problems, an efficient identity-based multi-bit proxy re-encryption over
   lattice in the standard model is constructed, which enlarges the
   plaintext space and improves the efficiency. What's more, the proposed
   multi-use and bidirectional scheme is proved to be CPA secure in the
   standard model. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is the
   processing of graphical data like images. Here, we investigate the
   possibility of realizing a quantum pattern recognition protocol based on
   swap test, and use the IBMQ noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
   devices to verify the idea. We find that with a two-qubit protocol, swap
   test can efficiently detect the similarity between two patterns with
   good fidelity, though for three or more qubits, the noise in the real
   devices becomes detrimental. To mitigate this noise effect, we resort to
   destructive swap test, which shows an improved performance for
   three-qubit states. Due to limited cloud access to larger IBMQ
   processors, we take a segment-wise approach to apply the destructive
   swap test on higher dimensional images. In this case, we define an
   average overlap measure which shows faithfulness to distinguish between
   two very different or very similar patterns when run on real IBMQ
   processors. As test images, we use binary images with simple patterns,
   grayscale MNIST numbers and fashion MNIST images, as well as binary
   images of human blood vessel obtained from magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). We also present an experimental set up for applying destructive
   swap test using the nitrogen vacancy (NVs) center in diamond. Our
   experimental data show high fidelity for single qubit states. Lastly, we
   propose a protocol inspired from quantum associative memory, which works
   in an analogous way to supervised learning for performing quantum
   pattern recognition using destructive swap test.},

Abstract = {The term ``optimization{''} refers to the process of identifying the
   best solution for a given problem. Optimization techniques such as TSP,
   categorization, scan, and ERP systems are used to solve a variety of
   real-world problems. Scheduling is an important domain of the
   optimization technique, and it is one of their primary application
   fields. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate and optimize
   cloud computing-based resource scheduling techniques. As a result, this
   paper proposes a quantum genetics-based resource allocation optimization
   strategy. The technique starts with quantum physics for encoding and
   population generation, then moves on to a genetic algorithm for
   searching the generated population. Following a search, the genetic
   algorithm returns resource sequences that match the search criteria, as
   well as a task list. The CPU consumption cycles are efficiently
   minimized by using the resulting sequences. The CloudSim simulation tool
   is also used to test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for resource
   scheduling. Finally, the system's output is determined by the
   algorithm's time complexity, space complexity, and CPU usage cycles. A
   comparison analysis of historically available resource allocation
   techniques is also carried out and compared to similar criteria. When
   compared to conventional resource allocation techniques, experimental
   findings indicate that the proposed quantum genetics concept provides
   superior efficiency.},

Abstract = {In the last decade, IoT has been widely used in smart cities, autonomous
   driving and Industry 4.0, which lead to improve efficiency, reliability,
   security and economic benefits. However, with the rapid development of
   new technologies, such as cognitive communication, cloud computing,
   quantum computing and big data, the IoT security is being confronted
   with a series of new threats and challenges. IoT device identification
   via Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) extracting from radio signals
   is a physical-layer method for IoT security. In physical-layer, RFF is a
   unique characteristic of IoT device themselves, which can difficultly be
   tampered. Just as people's unique fingerprinting, different IoT devices
   exhibit different RFF which can be used for identification and
   authentication. In this paper, the structure of IoT device
   identification is proposed, the key technologies such as signal
   detection, RFF extraction, and classification model is discussed.
   Especially, based on the random forest and Dempster-Shafer evidence
   algorithm, a novel ensemble learning algorithm is proposed. Through
   theoretical modeling and experimental verification, the reliability and
   differentiability of RFF are extracted and verified, the classification
   result is shown under the real IoT device environments.},

Abstract = {We observe a continuously increased use of Deep Learning (DL) as a
   specific type of Machine Learning (ML) for data-intensive problems
   (i.e., `big data') that requires powerful computing resources with
   equally increasing performance. Consequently, innovative heterogeneous
   High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems based on multi-core CPUs and
   many-core GPUs require an architectural design that addresses end user
   communities' requirements that take advantage of ML and DL. Still the
   workloads of end user communities of the simulation sciences (e.g.,
   using numerical methods based on known physical laws) needs to be
   equally supported in those architectures. This paper offers insights
   into the Modular Supercomputer Architecture (MSA) developed in the
   Dynamic Exascale Entry Platform (DEEP) series of projects to address the
   requirements of both simulation sciences and data-intensive sciences
   such as High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA). It shares insights into
   implementing the MSA in the Julich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) hosting
   Europe No. 1 Supercomputer Julich Wizard for European Leadership Science
   (JUWELS). We augment the technical findings with experience and lessons
   learned from two application communities case studies (i.e., remote
   sensing and health sciences) using the MSA with JUWELS and the DEEP
   systems in practice. Thus, the paper provides details into specific MSA
   design elements that enable significant performance improvements of ML
   and DL algorithms. While this paper focuses on MSA-based HPC systems and
   application experience, we are not losing sight of advances in Cloud
   Computing (CC) and Quantum Computing (QC) relevant for ML and DL.},

Abstract = {With SDN/NFV, the telecom industry embraces operational flexibility and
   cost optimization, while facing new risks from off-premise cloud
   computing, known as introspection by malicious operators. Introspection
   is identified as a serious risk only by the IT industry in general when
   considering cloud operation. To mitigate it, processor vendors have
   invested in the last decade to design Trusted Execution Environments
   (TEEs) plugged into their processor architectures. TEEs bring a quantum
   hardware-level security higher than any software-based security. They
   are all essentially aimed at protecting data and code when executed and
   processed in the cloud or in untrusted environment. In this paper, we
   emphasize on the blocking factors for the use of TEEs today: processor
   market fragmentation, major architectural and design deviations between
   TEEs from various CPU vendors and finally, a relatively complex
   enablement of these TEE technologies for non-security experts. We
   describe a code interpretation solution to break those blocking factors
   by providing a universal abstraction layer for TEEs. The paper gives a
   conceptual blueprint of a solution that enables Intel's SGX and AMD's
   SEV, defined as the most contemplated candidates in this paper for
   SDN/NFV or 5G deployment. Our study presents the key challenges and
   advanced functionalities we view as essential for meeting key SDN/NFV
   requirements and which are deploy ability, software performance and easy
   setup. Innovative directions are given to deal efficiently with these
   upcoming requirements.},

Abstract = {Scheduling is one of the most important issues in the operating system,
   such as the tasks must be affected to the appropriate virtual machines,
   considering different factors at the same time to ensure better use of
   resources. A lot of research has been carried out to propose more
   efficient task scheduling algorithms. Round robin is one of the most
   powerful algorithms in this field but its main challenge is the choice
   of time quantum. The effectiveness of Round Robin depends on the choice
   of this parameter. In this paper, we aimed to overcome these challenge
   by proposing an improved Round Robin scheduling algorithm using a
   variable time quantum based on an analytic model. Our analytical model
   takes into consideration different parameters to determine the order of
   tasks execution. The use of burst time as parameters in our model
   ensures a more suitable time quantum. This algorithm can be applied in
   any operating system and therefore in the cloud computing environment.
   In order to assess the performance and effectiveness of the proposed
   approach, five different scenarios have been implemented; the
   comparisons made with existing works have shown that the proposed
   approach improves the average waiting time and the average turnaround
   time, which ensures better scheduling of tasks and better use of
   resources. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press B.V.},

Title = {IPO-PEKS: Effective Inner Product Outsourcing Public Key Searchable
   Encryption From Lattice in the IoT},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {28926-28937},
Abstract = {Lightweight devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) typically need to
   store massive data on a cloud server with strong processing and storage
   capabilities for later retrieval and usage. Since these data contain the
   participant's sensitive information, they cannot be delivered directly
   to the cloud server. Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS)
   allows customers to search for target encrypted files using keywords.
   However, the majority of PEKS implementations are unable to repel
   malicious quantum-capable attackers. And with regard to forward
   security, they must search for many rounds to obtain the necessary data.
   To resolve these concerns, we propose a comprehensive Inner Product
   Outsourcing PEKS system (IPO-PEKS) with forward security based on LWE
   assumptions, which raises search efficiency by allowing authorized
   clients to find the information they desire in a single round and
   achieves more fine-grained searches. Furthermore, we offer an inner
   product outsourcing calculation technique that allows the server to
   compute the inner product result without knowing the details of both
   parties in order to conceal the relevant privacy data of transmitting
   and decryption states. The paradigm can be utilized for efficient state
   transition through the use of parallel computing to accomplish the
   target of one round of iteration.},

Abstract = {With recent advances made in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Cloud
   Computing (CC), the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) find it
   advantageous in terms of improvement in quality and interactivity of
   urban transportation service, mitigation of costs incurred, reduction in
   resource utilization, and improvement in traffic management
   capabilities. Many traffic related problems in future smart cities can
   be sorted out with the incorporation of IoV in transportation. IoV
   communication enables the collection and distribution of real-time
   essential data regarding road network condition. In this scenario,
   energy-efficient and reliable intercommunication routes are essential
   among vehicular nodes in sustainable urban computing. With this
   motivation, the current research article presents a new Artificial
   Intelligence-based Energy Efficient Clustering with Routing (AI-EECR)
   Protocol for IoV in urban computing. The proposed AI-EECR protocol
   operates under three stages namely, network initialization, Cluster Head
   (CH) selection, and routing protocol. The presented AI-EECR protocol
   determines the CHs from vehicles with the help of Quantum Chemical
   Reaction Optimization (QCRO) algorithm. QCRO algorithm derives a fitness
   function with the help of vehicle speed, trust level, and energy level
   of the vehicle. In order to make appropriate routing decisions, a set of
   relay nodes was selected using Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm
   (GTOA). The performance of the presented AI-EECR model, in terms of
   energy efficiency, was validated against different aspects and a brief
   comparative analysis was conducted. The experimental outcomes
   established that AI-EECR model outperformed the existing methods under
   different measures.},

Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) have opened the door to a world of unlimited
   possibilities for implementations in varied sectors in society, but it
   also has many challenges. One of those challenges is security and
   privacy. IoT devices are more susceptible to security threats and
   attacks. Due to constraints of the IoT devices such as area, power,
   memory, etc., there is a lack of security solutions that are compatible
   with IoT devices and applications, which is leading this world of
   securely connected things to the ``internet of insecure things.{''} A
   promising solution to this problem is going beyond the standard or
   classical techniques to implementing the security solutions in the
   hardware of the IoT device. The integration of emerging technologies in
   IoT networks, such as machine learning, blockchain, fog/edge/cloud
   computing, and quantum computing have added more vulnerable points in
   the network. This paper introduces a comprehensive study on IoT security
   threats and solutions. Additionally, this survey outlines how emerging
   technologies such as machine learning and blockchain are integrated in
   IoT, challenges resulted from this integration, and potential solutions
   to these challenges. The paper utilizes the 4-layer IoT architecture as
   a reference to identify security issues with corresponding solutions.},

Abstract = {Recent developments in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enable
   interconnected vehicles to support ubiquitous services. Various emerging
   service applications are promising to increase the Quality of Experience
   (QoE) of users. On-board computation tasks generated by these
   applications have heavily overloaded the resource-constrained vehicles,
   forcing it to offload on-board tasks to other edge intelligence
   (EI)-assisted servers. However, excessive task offloading can lead to
   severe competition for communication and computation resources among
   vehicles, thereby increasing the processing latency, energy consumption,
   and system cost. To address these problems, we investigate the
   transmission-awareness and computing-sense uplink resource management
   problem and formulate it as a time-varying Markov decision process.
   Considering the total delay, energy consumption, and cost,
   quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed to develop an
   intelligence-oriented edge offloading strategy. Specifically, the
   vehicle can flexibly choose the network access mode and offloading
   strategy through two different radio interfaces to offload tasks to
   multiaccess edge computing (MEC) servers through WiFi and cloud servers
   through 5G. The objective of this joint optimization is to maintain a
   self-adaptive balance between these two aspects. Simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the transmission
   latency and computation delay.},

Abstract = {Distributed cyber-infrastructures and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are
   transformative technologies that will play a pivotal role in the future
   of society and the scientific community. Internet of Things (IoT)
   applications harbor vast quantities of connected devices that collect a
   massive amount of sensitive information (e.g., medical, financial),
   which is usually analyzed either at the edge or federated cloud systems
   via AI/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make critical decisions
   (e.g., diagnosis). It is of paramount importance to ensure the security,
   privacy, and trustworthiness of data collection, analysis, and
   decision-making processes. However, system complexity and increased
   attack surfaces make these applications vulnerable to system breaches,
   single-point of failures, and various cyber-attacks. Moreover, the
   advances in quantum computing exacerbate the security and privacy
   challenges. That is, emerging quantum computers can break conventional
   cryptographic systems that offer cyber-security services, public key
   infrastructures, and privacy-enhancing technologies. Therefore, there is
   a vital need for new cyber-security paradigms that can address the
   resiliency, long-term security, and efficiency requirements of
   distributed cyber infrastructures.
   In this work, we propose a vision of distributed architecture and
   cyber-security framework that uniquely synergizes secure computation,
   Physical Quantum Key Distribution (PQKD), NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography
   (PQC) efforts, and AI/ML algorithms to achieve breach-resilient,
   functional and efficient cyber-security services. At the heart of our
   proposal lies a new Multi-Party Computation Quantum Network Core
   (MPC-QNC) that enables fast and yet quantum-safe execution of
   distributed computation protocols via integration of PQKD infrastructure
   and hardwareacceleration elements. We showcase the capabilities of
   MPCQNC by instantiating it for Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) and
   federated ML in our HDQPKI and TPQ-ML, frameworks, respectively. HDQPKI
   (to the best of our knowledge) is the first hybrid and distributed
   post-quantum PKI that harnesses PQKD and NIST PQC standards to offer the
   highest level of quantum safety with a breach-resiliency against active
   adversaries. TPQ-ML presents a post-quantum secure and
   privacy-preserving federated ML infrastructure.},

Abstract = {Data Processing Units (DPUs) are becoming increasingly popular,
   especially for use in conjunction with WarehouseScale Computers (WSCs)
   due to their ability to handle networking functions and data-centric
   workloads. Cost-performance, energy efficiency, network I/O, and batch
   processing workloads are important design factors for WSCs. Recent
   developments in AI and the never-ending increase in demand for data
   processing, cloud computing, and HPC set the optimisation of all those
   design factors as a high priority. DPUs can be utilised to achieve
   significant improvements in all those areas. This includes in-line
   network processing and upcoming enhanced security paradigms such as
   post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for quantum resilient communications or
   software-defined perimeters (SDP) for confidential computing
   implementations. Being P4-enabled and dRMT-based, DPUs allow for the
   reconfigurability of the network traffic without the need to change the
   hardware. However, the network performance on such devices is only
   sometimes deterministic since the actual traffic and the rules, both of
   which have to do with packet processing, are not known during compile
   time. In this paper, we envision how the network performance on DPUs can
   be accelerated. We describe the challenges that negatively impact the
   bandwidth and latency: the complex steering pipeline and the massive
   runtime needed to optimise. These challenges arise from the lack of
   information during compile time that is only known during runtime. Thus,
   we envision optimising during runtime by leveraging DPUs'
   reconfigurability on the network I/O. For this, we discuss the
   significant factors that must be considered to accelerate the network
   performance on such devices and we propose a solution for them.},

Title = {Quantum Firefly Secure Routing for Fog Based Wireless Sensor Networks},

Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) become an integral part of Internet of
   Things (IoT) and finds their applicability in several domains. As
   classical WSN faces several issues in service-based IoT applications,
   fog computing has been introduced in real-time, enabling local data
   processing and avoid raw data transmission to cloud servers. The
   Fog-based WSN generally involves advanced nodes, normal nodes, and some
   Fog Nodes (FN). Though the Fog-based WSN offers several benefits, there
   is a need to develop an effective trust-based secure routing protocol
   for data transmission among Cluster Heads (CHs) and FNs. In this view,
   this paper presents a Quantum Firefly Optimization based Multi
   -Objective Secure Routing (QFO-MOSR) protocol for Fog-based WSN. The
   main intention of the QFO-MOSR technique is to derive an optimal
   selection of routes between CHs and FNs in the network. The QFO-MOSR
   technique has incorporated the concepts of quantum computing and Firefly
   (FF) optimization algorithm inspired by the flashing behaviour of FFs.
   In addition, a multi-objective fitness function is derived by the
   QFO-MOSR technique using seven objectives: distance, inter-cluster
   distance, energy, delay, intra-cluster distance, link lifetime, and
   trust. The proposed routing technique derives a fitness function
   including trust factor from ensuring security. The design of the
   QFO-MOSR technique with a multi-objective fitness function shows the
   novelty of the work. To validate the performance of the QFO-MOSR
   technique, a series of experiments were carried out, and the results are
   investigated in terms of different measures. The experimental analysis
   ensured that the QFO-MOSR technique is superior to other methods in
   terms of different measures.},

Abstract = {The industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) integrates sensors,
   instruments, equipment and industrial applications, enabling traditional
   industries to automate and intelligently process data. To reduce the
   cost and demand of required service equipment, IIoT relies on cloud
   computing to further process and store data. Public-key encryption with
   keyword search (PEKS) plays an important role, due to its search
   functionality, to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the
   outsourced data and the maintenance of flexibility in the use of the
   data. Recently, Huang and Li proposed the `public-key authenticated
   encryption with keyword search' (PAEKS) to avoid the insider keyword
   guessing attacks (IKGAs) in the previous PEKS schemes. However, all
   current PAEKS schemes are based on the discrete logarithm assumption and
   are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. In this study, we first
   introduce a generic PAEKS construction, with the assistance of a trusted
   authority, that enjoys the security against IKGA in the standard model,
   if all building blocks are secure under standard model. Based on the
   framework, we further propose a novel instantiation of quantum-resistant
   PAEKS that is based on NTRU assumption under random oracle. Compared
   with its state-of-the-art counterparts, the experiment result indicates
   that our instantiation is more efficient and secure.},

Title = {Scalable CCA-secure public-key authenticated encryption with keyword
   search from ideal lattices in cloud computing},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Public-key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) is an
   important cryptographic primitive for realizing effective and
   confidential searches on encrypted data in cloud computing. Several
   PAEKS schemes with various appealing functionalities have been proposed
   in the literature. Nevertheless, most of them are based on the classical
   numbertheoretic assumptions and are impossible to resist quantum
   attacks. Their security is only proven against chosen-keyword attacks
   and is considered insufficient. Fortunately, ringLWE and ring-ISIS
   problems reduced from the worst-case ideal lattices are believed to be
   post-quantum secure and could be improved computational efficiency in
   constructions. In this paper, we propose a scalable PAEKS scheme based
   on ring-LWE and ring-ISIS by adopting the ring analog of lattice
   algorithms of both digital signature and searchable encryption schemes,
   in which signature algorithms are used to authenticate ciphertext,
   making our PAEKS resistant to insider keyword guessing attacks. The
   scheme is also proved secure against chosen-ciphertext attacks and token
   privacy attacks. In addition, we extend the PAEKS scheme to conjunctive
   keywords and multi-user settings to allow for realistic promotion. We
   finally implement our schemes and compare them with related
   counterparts, which shows that our constructions are efficient in
   practical applications. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A lattice-based efficient certificateless public key encryption for big
   data security in clouds},
Journal = {FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE},

Abstract = {With the advancement of technology and the development of digitization,
   big data has become an integral component of modern society. Due to the
   huge volume of big data, users generally upload data to the cloud for
   storage and computation. Because data in the cloud is beyond the control
   of users, it faces threats such as data security and personal privacy
   leakage. To address these concerns and achieve big data security and
   privacy protection in clouds, data encryption is crucial. Traditional
   public key encryption involves complex certificate management in a
   public key infrastructure (PKI). Although the identity -based encryption
   (IBE) scheme avoids the management of public key certificates, it has
   issues with key escrows and identity revocation. The certificateless
   public key encryption (CL-PKE) not only solves the key escrows problem
   in IBE, but also maintains its advantage of not requiring the use of
   certificate in PKI, making it suitable for the security protection of
   big data in clouds. However, most CL-PKE schemes are constructed based
   on large integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which
   cannot resist quantum computing attacks. Therefore, this paper proposes
   an efficient lattice -based CL-PKE scheme for big data security in
   clouds. In addition, the proposed scheme is extended to a lattice -based
   certificateless proxy re -encryption scheme, facilitating secure big
   data sharing in clouds. The proposed CL-PKE scheme can resist attacks
   from both internal and external adversaries, and has been proven to be
   IND-CPA secure under the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.
   Experiments have shown that the proposed CL-PKE scheme has lower
   computational and communication costs. The proposed lattice -based
   schemes can effectively provide post quantum security for the security
   and privacy protection of big data in clouds.},

Abstract = {By implementing a high-frequency intelligent network of sensors, this
   work explores continuous monitoring and alerting for dynamic changes in
   water quality. Life depends on water, yet pollution is a greater menace.
   For this reason, precautions and careful observation are necessary.
   Typically, the focus on conventional water quality system monitoring is
   too much on data collection and needs more on analysis and extraction,
   limiting its capacity to offer thorough solutions. Making informed
   decisions becomes more complicated when there are discrepancies like
   damaged data, loss from power outages, or transmission issues. The
   proposed High-Frequency Intelligent Sensing Network (HFISN) monitoring
   system uses cloud computing, IoT and Big data technologies for
   intelligent sensing. Researchers developed it to address various
   challenges. Researchers recommend Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU)
   Sensor installation to enhance the system's performance and facilitate
   better monitoring of sedimentation, particle issues, and water purity.
   This sensor makes it possible to make more informed decisions by
   expanding the platform's dataset. The solution not only resolves data
   cleaning and analysis issues but also includes intelligent early-warning
   capabilities for timely alerts. Quantum Cloud (QC) technology is
   employed to enhance security and accessibility. Test findings confirm
   its robustness with extra features and a built-in turbidity sensor.
   Because the platform ensures data accuracy and dependability, it
   provides decision-makers with a solid foundation to protect water
   resources.},

Abstract = {Combined with highly developed technologies such as cloud computing and
   the Internet of Things, the integrated energy system (IES) has realized
   the coordinated scheduling and utilization of various energy resources
   with its superiority of comprehensive control and high applicability.
   Meanwhile, approaches to enhance the quality of service (QoS), e.g.
   network lifetime, energy distribution, and data transmission delay, of
   an indispensable component of IES, i.e., integrated energy system
   wireless sensor networks (IESWSNs), have become an urgent research
   issue. To tackle the issue, a high-performance clustering protocol
   termed quantum clone whale optimization algorithm (HPCP-QCWOA) is
   proposed for IESWSNs. By designing a new quantum operator and a new
   layering clone operator, HPCP-QCWOA can find an approximate optimal
   clustering scheme to improve the QoS performance of IESWSNs. Unlike
   other population-based clustering protocols, a new objective function
   that embraces remaining energy, intra-cluster distance, BS distance, and
   data transmission delay is designed in the HPCP-QCWOA, which renders its
   clustering performance more desirable than some other state-of-the-art
   clustering protocols, i.e., O-LEACH, LDIWPSO, and ARSH-FATI-CHS.
   Empirically, simulation experiments under different scenarios
   illustrated that the lifetime of the HPCP-QCWOA-based clustering has
   increased by 28.78\%, 25.50\% and 11.22\% respectively compared with
   O-LEACH, LDIWPSO, and ARSH-FATI-CHS. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Secure and Efficient Multi-Authority Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme
   From Lattices},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {3665-3674},
Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) mechanism on lattices can against
   quantum attack and guarantees fine-grained access control of encrypted
   data, and it has been widely used in cloud computing and privacy
   protection. However, the high complexity of the trapdoor generation and
   delegation and preimage sampling are the main barriers for the
   development of ABE schemes in a post-quantum world. Thus, we proposed a
   security and efficient multi-authority ABE scheme from lattices in this
   paper. The scheme is based on the theory of MP12 and is proved to be
   secure under the standard model. In this scheme, we construct an
   optimized sampling algorithm to generate a Z(q)-invertible matrix with a
   lower runtime. Based on it, combining the trapdoor generation and
   delegation algorithm in MP12, we designed multiple attribute authorities
   which can manage different attribute sets and generate private keys for
   the user independently. In addition, the Shamir's secret sharing
   technique is introduced to support policies expressed in any monotone
   access structures. Compared with the existing related schemes, the
   proposed scheme can improve the functional agility and the flexibility
   of the access policy prominently, and it also can achieve a better
   performance with less lattice dimension, trapdoor storage occupation,
   and ciphertext expansion rate. The analysis shows that our scheme is
   feasible and superior in the large-scale distributed environment.},

Title = {MLQD: A package for machine learning-based quantum dissipative dynamics},
Journal = {COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {294},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as a promising paradigm to study the
   quantum dissipative dynamics of open quantum systems. To facilitate the
   use of our recently published ML-based approaches for quantum
   dissipative dynamics, here we present an open-source Python package MLQD
   (https:// github .com /Arif -PhyChem /MLQD), which currently supports
   the three ML-based quantum dynamics approaches: (1) the recursive
   dynamics with kernel ridge regression (KRR) method, (2) the
   non-recursive artificial-intelligence-based quantum dynamics (AIQD)
   approach and (3) the blazingly fast one-shot trajectory learning (OSTL)
   approach, where both AIQD and OSTL use the convolutional neural networks
   (CNN). This paper describes the features of the MLQD package, the
   technical details, optimization of hyperparameters, visualization of
   results, and the demonstration of the MLQD's applicability for two
   widely studied systems, namely the spin-boson model and the
   Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. To make MLQD more user-friendly and
   accessible, we have made it available on the Python Package Index (PyPi)
   platform and it can be installed via pip install mlqd. In addition, it
   is also available on the XACS cloud computing platform
   (https://XACScloud .com) via the interface to the MLATOM package

Title = {Lattice-Based Key-Aggregate (Searchable) Encryption in Cloud Storage},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {164544-164555},
Abstract = {In cloud storage, selectively sharing encrypted data is becoming
   increasingly important. One key design challenge is the management of
   encryption keys. Traditionally, a large quantity of encryption keys have
   to be managed by the data owner, and an equally large number of keyword
   trapdoors must be sent to the cloud for the purpose of searching over
   the shared data, which are cumbersome in terms of secure communication
   and management. Recently, key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes
   have been introduced to alleviate the problem. However, they were only
   designed under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption in the
   prior works. Lattice-based key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes
   are valuable, because they have security against quantum computing
   attacks, average-case to worse-case equivalence as well as simplicity
   and potential efficiency. Here we propose a key-aggregate encryption
   scheme and a key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme which are both
   based on a lattice problem (i.e., the Learning with Errors problem).
   Some key techniques are employed during the construction of the schemes.
   A basis delegation algorithm is designed to generate the aggregate key
   without increasing the lattice dimension. The encryption algorithms of
   the two schemes are trickily devised to make the encrypted files
   decryptable or searchable. To overcome the problem of general matrix
   multiplication failing to satisfy commutative law, a hash function is
   designed by using diagonalizable matrices to make the encrypted file
   decryptable and the trapdoor adjustable.We present the schemes'
   correctness proof, formal security analysis as well as performance
   analysis, which confirm that they are provably secure and practically
   efficient. To the best of our knowledge, the former is the first
   lattice-based key-aggregate encryption scheme and the latter is the
   first lattice-based key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme. We also
   demonstrate their application to cloud storage for searchable group data
   sharing by combining the two schemes.},

Abstract = {Current cryptographic solutions used in information technologies today
   like Transport Layer Security utilize algorithms with underlying
   computationally difficult problems to solve. With the ongoing research
   and development of quantum computers, these same computationally
   difficult problems become solvable within reasonable (polynomial) time.
   The emergence of large-scale quantum computers would put the integrity
   and confidentiality of today's data in jeopardy. It then becomes urgent
   to develop, implement, and test a new suite of cybersecurity measures
   against attacks from a quantum computer. This paper explores,
   understands, and evaluates this new category of cryptosystems as well as
   the many tradeoffs among them. All the algorithms submitted to the
   National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for
   standardization can be categorized into three major categories, each
   relating to the new underlying hard problem: namely error code
   correcting, algebraic lattices (including ring learning with errors),
   and supersingular isogenies. These new mathematical hard problems have
   shown to be resistant to the same type of quantum attack. Utilizing
   hardware clock cycle registers, the work sets up the benchmarks of the
   four Round 3 NIST algorithms in two environments: cloud computing and
   embedded system. As expected, there are many tradeoffs and advantages in
   each algorithm for applications. Saber and Kyber are exceedingly fast
   but have larger ciphertext size for transmission over a wire. McEliece
   key size and key generation are the largest drawbacks but having the
   smallest ciphertext size and only slightly decreased performance allow a
   use case where key reuse is prioritized. NTRU finds a middle ground in
   these tradeoffs, being better than McEliece performance wise and better
   than Kyber and Saber in ciphertext size allows for a use case of highly
   varied environments, which need to value speed and ciphertext size
   equally. Going forward, the benchmarking system developed could be
   applied to digital signature, another vital aspect to a cryptosystem.},

Title = {Lattice-Based Searchable Encryption With Keywords Revocable and Bounded
   Trapdoor Exposure Resistance},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {43179-43189},
Abstract = {Searchable encryption plays a vital role in keeping data privacy of
   current cloud storage. Considering the security threat of trapdoor
   exposure, Emura et al. introduced a formal definition of keywords
   revocable public-key encryption with keywords search (KR-PEKS), which
   satisfies trapdoor exposure resistance (TER) and trapdoor
   re-generability. However, there is little work on lattice-based
   searchable encryption schemes to have the above properties, while it was
   widely accepted that cryptosystem on lattice has the potential to resist
   quantum computing attack. In this paper, we give a model of KR-PEKS with
   novel security, called bounded TER, i.e., a bounded number (previously
   set) of trapdoors for per keyword are exposed, which cannot affect other
   keywords. Then, we propose a lattice-based KR-PEKS scheme with bounded
   TER and trapdoor re-generability and show that this scheme is secure
   under the hardness assumption of learning with errors (LWE) problem.
   Finally, we conduct some simulation experiments on our scheme and give a
   comparison, which indicates that our scheme has less computational cost
   than the prior arts.},

Abstract = {The advent of the fourth industrial revolution along with developments
   in other emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things, big data,
   artificial intelligence as well as cloud and quantum computing, smart
   healthcare systems (SHS) are becoming ubiquitous in our daily lives.
   Meanwhile, patients, doctors, and other medical personnel rely on the
   safe and efficient storage, transmission, and analysis of medical images
   and electronic health records for successful diagnosis, treatment, and
   management of different ailments. Moreover since, for various reasons,
   medical images are always the target of different illicit criminal
   activities, studies to utilise advanced information technologies to
   safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such data
   have become a major priority in all SHS platforms. Our study evaluates
   recent efforts to deploy emerging technologies to design, secure, and
   enhance the efficiency of SHS that are based on medical images. It is
   hoped that this work will stimulate further interest aimed at the
   pursuit of more advanced algorithms and frameworks covering all aspects
   of security and privacy in emerging and future smart healthcare
   applications.},

Abstract = {The Industrial Revolution 1.0 thrived in eighteenth century with
   factories and machines such as steam engines leading to mechanization of
   production. The Industrial Revolution 2.0 was propelled by electricity-
   and oil-based power in nineteenth century for mass production. The
   Industrial Revolution 3.0 was cultivated in the twentieth century
   through Electronics and Information and Communication Technologies for
   automatic production. The current phase of Industrial Revolution 4.0 in
   twenty-first century is built over the Industrial Revolution 3.0; but
   indeed is distinct from it due to its exponential growth, scope and
   impact across different sectors and industries in the Anthropocene age
   or era of humans. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is led by technologies
   with `Digital Intelligence' such as `Internet of things', `Artificial
   Intelligence', `Cloud Computing', `Quantum Computing', etc. Within the
   artificial intelligence (AI), the generative artificial intelligence
   (GAI) with its scale, scope, and complexity will progress toward a
   period that humankind has never experienced before. Parallel to the
   development of the digitally intelligent machines have emerged a new set
   of generational human rights which can also be called as `Digital
   Rights' to safeguard our human rights in digital space. Right to be
   forgotten (RTBF) is one such emerging legal and digital right in civil,
   criminal, and tortious justice system. This research paper discusses the
   role of RTBF in the realm of one the prominent `Digitally Intelligent'
   technology-GAI and discusses the conflicts of interests and rights
   arising between RTBF and GAI models.},

Title = {Energy-Efficient Sub-Carrier and Power Allocation in Cloud-Based
   Cellular Network With Ambient RF Energy Harvesting},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {1340-1352},
Abstract = {Due to the limited battery energy of mobile devices, the issue of
   energy-efficient resource allocation has drawn significant interest in
   the mobile cloud computing area. Simultaneous wireless information and
   power transfer (SWIPT) is an innovative way to provide electrical energy
   for mobile devices. Extensive research on the resource allocation
   problem is conducted in SWIPT systems. However, most previous works
   mainly focus on energy harvesting over a relatively narrow frequency
   range. Due to small amounts of energy harvested by the users, the
   practical implementations are usually limited to low power devices. In
   this paper, an energy-efficient uplink resource allocation problem is
   investigated in a cloud-based cellular network with ambient radio
   frequency (RF) energy harvesting. In order to obtain sufficient energy,
   a broadband rectenna is equipped at the user device to harvest ambient
   RF energy over six frequency bands at the same time. From the viewpoint
   of service arrival in the ambient transmitter, a new energy arrival
   model is presented. The joint problem of sub-carrier and power
   allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming
   problem. The objective is to maximize the energy efficiency while
   satisfying the energy consumption constraint and the total data rate
   requirement. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a
   suboptimal solution to the optimization problem is derived by employing
   a quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm.
   Simulation results show that more energy can be harvested by the user
   devices compared with narrow band SWIFT systems, and the QPSO method
   achieves higher energy efficiency than a conventional particle swarm
   optimization approach.},

Title = {Securing Additive Manufacturing with Blockchains and Distributed
   Physically Unclonable Functions},
Journal = {CRYPTOGRAPHY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {4},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Blockchain technology is a game-changing, enhancing security for the
   supply chain of smart additive manufacturing. Blockchain enables the
   tracking and recording of the history of each transaction in a ledger
   stored in the cloud that cannot be altered, and when blockchain is
   combined with digital signatures, it verifies the identity of the
   participants with its non-repudiation capabilities. One of the
   weaknesses of blockchain is the difficulty of preventing malicious
   participants from gaining access to public-private key pairs. Groups of
   opponents often interact freely with the network, and this is a security
   concern when cloud-based methods manage the key pairs. Therefore, we are
   proposing end-to-end security schemes by both inserting tamper-resistant
   devices in the hardware of the peripheral devices and using ternary
   cryptography. The tamper-resistant devices, which are designed with
   nanomaterials, act as Physical Unclonable Functions to generate secret
   cryptographic keys. One-time use public-private key pairs are generated
   for each transaction. In addition, the cryptographic scheme incorporates
   a third logic state to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks. The
   generation of these public-private key pairs is compatible with post
   quantum cryptography. The third scheme we are proposing is the use of
   noise injection techniques used with high-performance computing to
   increase the security of the system. We present prototypes to
   demonstrate the feasibility of these schemes and to quantify the
   relevant parameters. We conclude by presenting the value of blockchains
   to secure the logistics of additive manufacturing operations.},

Title = {Proofs of retrievability with tag outsourcing based on Goppa codes},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {86},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In cloud storage, because the data owner loses the physical control of
   the data, the data may be tampered with or deleted. Although, it has
   been proposed to adopt provable data possession (PDP) or proofs of
   retrievability (POR) mechanism to ensure the integrity of cloud storage
   data. However, at present, most PDP/POR schemes are based on traditional
   cryptographic mechanisms and cannot resist quantum computer attacks. For
   this reason, the first POR scheme based on coding mechanism (BC-POR) is
   proposed in this paper. The scheme is constructed based on the
   difficulty assumptions of 2-regular word syndrome decoding (2-RWSD)
   problem and Goppa code distinguishing problem. Moreover, considering the
   low computing power of lightweight users, this paper adopts an audit
   scheme that supports the outsourcing of data tag calculation on the
   client side, that is, the calculation of data tag generation is
   outsourced to a third-party institution for execution. First of all,
   this scheme can prevent third-party institution from obtaining the real
   content of the data in the process of calculation tags and realize the
   privacy protection of user data. Secondly, the scheme uses a FSB hash
   function to generate a decodable syndrome, and this algorithm does not
   require iterative operations during the tagging process, thereby
   reducing the computational overhead of the tag. Finally, the provable
   security method is used to prove the security of the proposed scheme,
   and the performance of the proposed audit scheme is evaluated to prove
   the effectiveness of the scheme.},

Title = {Attribute-based Encryption for Cloud Computing Access Control: A Survey},
Journal = {ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {53},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) for cloud computing access control is
   reviewed in this article. A taxonomy and comprehensive assessment
   criteria of ABE are first proposed. In the taxonomy, ABE schemes are
   assorted into key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) schemes, ciphertext-policy ABE
   (CP-ABE) schemes, anti-quantum ABE schemes, and generic constructions.
   In accordance with cryptographically functional features, CP-ABE is
   further divided into nine subcategories with regard to basic
   functionality, revocation, accountability, policy hiding, policy
   updating, multi-authority, hierarchy, offline computation, and
   outsourced computation. In addition, a systematical methodology for
   discussing and comparing existing ABE schemes is proposed. For KP-ABE
   and each type of CP-ABE, the corresponding access control scenario is
   presented and explained by concrete examples. Specifically, the syntax
   of ABE is given followed by the adversarial model and security goals.
   ABE schemes are discussed according to the design strategies and special
   features and are compared in the light of the proposed assessment
   criteria with respect to security and performance. Compared to related
   state-of-the-art survey papers, this article not only provides a broader
   12 categories of ABE schemes, but also makes a more comprehensive and
   holistic comparison. Finally, a number of open research challenges in
   ABE are pointed out.},

Abstract = {The increasing focus on privacy and security in 6G networks, which are
   intelligence-native, necessitates the use of quantum key
   distribution-secured semantic information communication (QKD-SIC) to
   protect confidential data. In QKD-SIC systems, edge devices connected
   via quantum channels can efficiently encrypt semantic information from
   the semantic source, and securely transmit the encrypted semantic
   information to the semantic destination. In this article, we consider an
   efficient resource (i.e., quantum key distribution (QKD) and KM
   wavelengths) sharing problem to support QKD-SIC systems under the
   uncertainty of semantic information generated by edge devices. In such a
   system, QKD service providers offer QKD services with different
   subscription options to the edge devices. The QKD services are
   envisioned to follow cloud computing that has the subscription in the
   reservation and on-demand options, i.e., for long and short (immediate)
   terms, respectively. As such, to reduce the cost for the edge device
   users, we propose a QKD resource management framework for the edge
   devices communicating semantic information. The framework is based on a
   two-stage stochastic optimization model to achieve optimal QKD
   deployment. Moreover, to reduce the deployment cost of QKD service
   providers, QKD resources in the proposed framework can be utilized based
   on efficient QKD-SIC resource management, including semantic information
   transmission among edge devices, secret-key provisioning, and
   cooperation formation among QKD service providers. In detail, the
   formulated two-stage stochastic optimization model can achieve the
   optimal QKD-SIC resource deployment while meeting the secret-key
   requirements for semantic information transmission of edge devices.
   Moreover, to share the cost of the QKD resource pool among cooperative
   QKD service providers forming a coalition in a fair and interpretable
   manner, the proposed framework leverages the concept of Shapley value
   from cooperative game theory as a solution. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce the deployment cost
   by about 40\% compared with existing noncooperative baselines.},

Abstract = {The video request service of users in 5G network will explode, and
   adaptive bit rate technology can provide users with reliable video
   response. Placing video resources on edge servers close to users can
   overcome the problem of excessive network load similar to traditional
   centralized cloud platform solutions. Moreover, multiple edge servers
   can provide caching and transcoding support by collaboration mechanisms,
   which further improves users' Quality of Experience (QoE). However, the
   design difficulty of video caching and content distribution strategies
   is increased due to the diversity of collaboration mechanisms and the
   competition between local and collaborative services of edge servers for
   computing and storage resources. In order to solve this problem, video
   cache and content distribution problem is modeled as random integer
   programming problem in the multi-edge server at most two-hop
   collaboration scenario. In order to improve the security of video data
   transmission, the video stream is encrypted using an encryption
   algorithm based on Logistic chaotic-Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA).
   For improving the efficiency of solving integer programming problems,
   this paper uses a pyramid intelligent evolution algorithm based on
   optimal cooperation strategy to solve this problem. Simulation
   experiments show that our proposed method can obtain higher QoE value
   compared with several newer methods. In addition, the average access
   delay of proposed method is shortened by more than 27.98\%, which
   verifies its reliability.},

Title = {Inner product encryption from Middle-Product Learning With Errors},
Journal = {COMPUTER STANDARDS \& INTERFACES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {87},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Inner product encryption (IPE) is an important research area of
   functional cryptosystems. It can improve user access control and
   fine-grained query, and has a wide range of applications in emerging
   fields such as cloud computing. Lattice-based inner product encryption
   has the advantages of resistance to quantum algorithm attacks and
   relatively simple encryption algorithms, and thus has good application
   prospects. Currently, the provable security of lattice-based public key
   encryption schemes is mostly based on the learning with errors (LWE) and
   polynomial learning with errors (PLWE) problems. However, most of the
   encryption schemes based on LWE problems suffer from the problem of
   oversized public keys and ciphers. Although encryption schemes based on
   the PLWE problem further reduce the size, their hardness is limited by
   polynomials and the security guarantees are weakened. Compared with the
   LWE and PLWE problems, the Middle-Product Learning With Errors (MP-LWE)
   problem relaxes the polynomial restriction and makes full use of the
   polynomial features to achieve a better balance between security and
   efficiency. Inspired by this, we have proposed the inner product
   encryption scheme of Sel-IND-CPA-secure in SocialSec 2022. In this
   paper, to extend the existing work and improve the functionality of IPE,
   we construct single-input and multi-input inner product encryption
   schemes of Ad-IND-CPA-secure, and also evaluate the efficiency of the
   schemes.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) amalgamates the Internet of Things
   (IoT) with medical devices, revolutionizing health care by providing
   cost-effective solutions and expediting patient treatments. The
   burgeoning use of IoMT has ushered in significant data security
   challenges, prompting investigations into blockchain and IPFS
   (InterPlanetary File System) solutions. However, many of these solutions
   lean heavily on key-based encryption, which is increasingly vulnerable
   to emerging cryptographic advancements, such as quantum computing.
   Moreover, certain solutions overlook the potential threat posed by
   resource-abundant attackers like corrupted cloud service providers, who
   could exploit IPFS nodes for unauthorized data access within an IPFS
   cluster. Thus, ensuring data confidentiality within the IoMT
   architecture is a pressing concern. To address these challenges, we
   propose an innovative architecture that combines blockchain and IPFS,
   bolstered by a secret sharing algorithm (SSA) for robust data
   protection. Our architecture leverages SSA to fragment data and securely
   stores these fragments on publicly accessible IPFS clusters. SSA's
   information-theoretic security guarantees data confidentiality, even
   when a portion of IPFS nodes is compromised and key-based encryption is
   circumvented. By integrating SSA, our architecture adeptly harnesses the
   decentralization and scalability advantages of public IPFS clusters.
   Moreover, the inclusion of a public blockchain within our architecture
   enhances transparency and trust throughout the data uploading and
   sharing processes. A prototype of our proposed architecture is
   implemented and tested within an IoMT-based monitoring scenario to
   investigate its feasibility, scalability, and performance.},

Abstract = {Node attributes such as MAC and IP addresses, and even GPS position, can
   be considered as exclusive identity in the distributed networks such as
   cloud computing platform, wireless body area networks, and Internet of
   Things. Nodes can exchange or transmit some important information in the
   networks. However, with the openness and exposure of node in the
   networks, the communications between the nodes are facing a lot of
   security issues. In particular, sensitive information may be leaked to
   the attackers in the presence of side-channel attacks, memory leakages,
   and time attacks. In this paper, we present a new notion of
   attribute-based hash proof system (AB-HPS) in the bounded key-leakage
   model, to be resistant to the possible quantum attackers. The notion of
   AB-HPSs is so attractive and powerful and can be considered as implicit
   proofs of membership for languages. We also give a construction of
   AB-HPS in lattices and prove the security of indistinguishability of
   valid and invalid cipher-text and leakage smoothness under the
   decisional learning-with errors assumption. We also provide the general
   leakage-resilient attribute-based encryption construction using AB-HPS
   as the primitive without indistinguishable obfuscator. Finally, we
   discuss some extensions to improve the schemes in larger space for the
   message, larger alphabet for the attribute, and arbitrary access
   structure for the policy, respectively. We also give the performance
   evaluation in theoretic analysis and practical computation.},

Abstract = {Consolidating multiple virtual machines into a single server has been
   widely adopted in cloud computing to improve system utilization.
   However, the sharing of physical CPUs among virtual machines in
   consolidated systems poses a new challenge in providing an illusion of
   continuous CPU execution to the guest operating systems (OS). Due to the
   time-sharing of physical CPUs, the execution of a guest OS is
   periodically interrupted, while the guest OS may not be aware of the
   discontinuity of virtual time against the real time. The virtual time
   discontinuity problem causes the delayed processing of critical OS
   operations, such as interrupt handling and lock processing. Although
   there have been several prior studies to mitigate the problem, they
   address only a subset of symptoms, require the modification of guest
   OSes, or change the processor architecture. This paper proposes a novel
   way to comprehensively reduce the inefficiency of guest OS execution in
   consolidated systems. It migrates the short-lived critical OS tasks to
   dedicated micro-sliced cores, minimizing the delays caused by time
   sharing. The hypervisor identifies the critical OS tasks without any OS
   intervention, and schedules the critical code sections onto the
   dynamically partitioned cores at runtime. The dedicated micro sliced
   cores employ a short sub-millisecond quantum to minimize the response
   latencies for consolidated virtual machines. By readily servicing the
   critical tasks, the proposed scheme can minimize the adverse artifact of
   virtual machine consolidation without any modification of guest OSes.},

Title = {Efficient quantum-based security protocols for information sharing and

Abstract = {Fifth generation (5G) networks aim at utilizing many promising
   communication technologies, such as Cloud Computing, Network Slicing,
   and Software Defined Networking. Supporting a massive number of
   connected devices with 5G advanced technologies and innovating new
   techniques will surely bring tremendous challenges for trust, security
   and privacy. Therefore, secure mechanisms and protocols are required as
   the basis for 5G networks to address this security challenges and follow
   security-by-design but also security-by-operations rules. In this
   context, new efficient cryptographic protocols and mechanisms are needed
   in order to design and achieve information sharing and data protection
   protocols in 5G networks. In the literature, several security schemes
   based on unproven assumptions of computational complexity and
   mathematical models were proposed. However, the cryptanalysis is able to
   break most of the existing proposals in the presence of several weakest
   links in the designs. Recently, quantum walks (QWs) have been introduced
   as an excellent mechanism for generating cryptographic keys due to its
   nonlinear chaotic dynamical performance, high sensitivity to initial
   control parameters, stability and very large key space theoretically
   strong enough to resist various known attacks. This paper firstly
   proposes two efficient hash function mechanisms for 5G networks
   applications based on QWs, namely QWHF-1 and QWHF-2. Then, based on
   these hash functions, two efficient security protocols for securing data
   in 5G network scenario are proposed. Performance analyses and simulation
   results show that the proposed approaches are characterized with high
   security, efficiency, and robustness against several well-known attacks
   which nominate them as excellent candidates for securing 5G
   applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {TorsionNet: A Deep Neural Network to Rapidly Predict Small-Molecule
   Torsional Energy Profiles with the Accuracy of Quantum Mechanics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND MODELING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {62},
Number = {4},
Pages = {785-800},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {Fast and accurate assessment of small-molecule dihedral energetics is
   crucial for molecular design and optimization in medicinal chemistry.
   Yet, accurate prediction of torsion energy profiles remains challenging
   as the current molecular mechanics (MM) methods are limited by
   insufficient coverage of drug-like chemical space and accurate quantum
   mechanical (QM) methods are too expensive. To address this limitation,
   we introduce TorsionNet, a deep neural network (DNN) model specifically
   developed to predict small-molecule torsion energy profiles with
   QM-level accuracy. We applied active learning to identify nearly 50k
   fragments (with elements H, C, N, O, F, S, and Cl) that maximized the
   coverage of our corporate compound library and leveraged massively
   parallel cloud computing resources for density functional theory (DFT)
   torsion scans of these fragments, generating a training data set of 1.2
   million DFT energies. After training TorsionNet on this data set, we
   obtain a model that can rapidly predict the torsion energy profile of
   typical drug-like fragments with DFT-level accuracy. Importantly, our
   method also provides an uncertainty estimate for the predicted profiles
   without any additional calculations. In this report, we show that
   TorsionNet can accurately identify the preferred dihedral geometries
   observed in crystal structures. Our TorsionNet-based analysis of a
   diverse set of protein-ligand complexes with measured binding affinity
   shows a strong association between high ligand strain and low potency.
   We also present practical applications of TorsionNet that demonstrate
   how consideration of DNN-based strain energy leads to substantial
   improvement in existing lead discovery and design workflows.
   TorsionNet500, a benchmark data set comprising 500 chemically diverse
   fragments with DFT torsion profiles (12k MM- and DFT-optimized
   geometries and energies), has been created and is made publicly
   available.},

Title = {A Post-Quantum Fuzzy Commitment Scheme for Biometric Template
   Protection: An Experimental Study},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {110952-110961},
Abstract = {The proliferation and extensive acceptance of biometrics in many sectors
   is due to its merits over traditional password-based authentication.
   Several biometric template protection schemes have been proposed during
   the last decade to address the security and privacy issues related to
   biometrics. While error-correcting coding is required in the design of
   these schemes, it has been shown to degrade security and accuracy
   performance. In this study, a new post-quantum fuzzy commitment scheme
   (PQFC) for biometric template protection is designed, which is proved to
   be secure based on the Short Vector Problem (SVP) of the lattice. The
   present work provides the first systematic construction of biometric
   template protection that does not rely on error-correcting codes. To
   that purpose, a novel biometric-based PQFC authentication system based
   on a smartcard is created, with the biometric template protected by
   PQFC. Furthermore, biometric matching is done indirectly. The
   biometric-based PQFC authentication system is examined using an iris
   database of 108 individuals. According to the experimental data, the
   accuracy of iris recognition with PQFC is 99.1 percent, which is higher
   than the accuracy without PQFC, which is 97.4 percent. A False Accepting
   Rate (FAR) of 0\% is achieved, while the False Rejection Rate (FRR) is
   2.9\%. The FRR can be adjusted by employing the best standard iris
   recognition algorithm. The execution time for the essential operations
   of PQFC and the storage requirements are estimated. Furthermore, the
   security of the proposed authentication system is analyzed, showing that
   the renewability, unlinkability, and irreversibility of the ISO/IEC
   24745 standard are fulfilled without downgrading the accuracy. The
   overall performance of this work demonstrated that the PQFC is a
   promising technique for biometric template protection that is also
   suitable for the Internet of Things and cloud computing applications.},

Title = {Comprehensive Assessment of Torsional Strain in Crystal Structures of
   Small Molecules and Protein-Ligand Complexes using ab Initio
   Calculations},

Abstract = {The energetics of rotation around single bonds (torsions) is a key
   determinant of the three-dimensional shape that druglike molecules adopt
   in solution, the solid state, and in different biological environments,
   which in turn defines their unique physical and pharmacological
   properties. Therefore, accurate characterization of torsion angle
   preference and energetics is essential for the success of computational
   drug discovery and design. Here, we analyze torsional strain in crystal
   structures of druglike molecules in Cambridge structure database (CSD)
   and bioactive ligand conformations in protein data bank (PDB),
   expressing the total strain energy as a sum of strain energy from
   constituent rotatable bonds. We utilized cloud computing to generate
   torsion scan profiles of a very large collection of chemically diverse
   neutral fragments at DFT(B3LYP)/6-31G{*}//6-31G{*}{*} or
   DFT(B3LYP)/6-31+G{*}//6-31+G{*}{*} (for sulfur-containing molecule).
   With the data generated from these ab initio calculations, we performed
   rigorous analysis of strain torsion angles relative to their ideal
   gas-phase geometries. Contrary to the previous studies based on
   molecular mechanics, we find that in the crystalline state, molecules
   generally adopt low-strain conformations, with median per-torsion strain
   energy in CSD and PDB under one-tenth and one-third of a kcal/mol,
   respectively. However, for a small fraction (<5\%) of motifs, external
   effects such as steric hindrance and hydrogen bonds result in strain
   penalty exceeding 2.5 kcal/mol. We find that due to poor quality of PDB
   structures in general, bioactive structures tend to have higher
   torsional strain compared to small-molecule crystal conformations.
   However, in the absence of structural fitting artifacts in PDB
   structures, protein-induced strain in bioactive conformations is
   quantitatively similar to those due to the packing forces in
   small-molecule crystal structures. This analysis allows us to establish
   strain energy thresholds to help identify biologically relevant
   conformers in a given ensemble. The work presented here is the most
   comprehensive study to date that demonstrates the utility and
   feasibility of gas-phase quantum mechanics (QM) calculations to study
   conformational preference and energetics of drug-size molecules.
   Potential applications of this study in computational lead discovery and
   structure-based design are discussed.},

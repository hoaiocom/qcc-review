Quantum algorithm exploration and verification based on quantum computing cloud platform has become one of the important ways. Quantum Neural Network (QNN) combines quantum computing theory with artificial neural network, which is expected to provide potential solutions for classification problems and so on. In the algorithm execution process, factors such as encoding layer, ansatz, and optimizer have all influenced the results. Based on the quantum simulator provided on the quantum computing cloud platform, QNN has been used for experimental validation to study the effects of encoding methods, ansatz types and optimizer variations on the accuracy of QNN training results.

	abstract = {Range query in cloud-based outsourcing applications is an important data search service, but it can suffer from privacy disclosure. In this paper, to enhance the security and privacy of sensitive data, we introduce quantum cryptographic technologies and present a feasible quantum approach to address an important range query, i.e., privacy-preserving range MAX/MIN query. First, we define a primitive protocol of secure multiparty computations, called Oblivious Set Inclusion Decision (OSID), in which two parties jointly decide whether a private set includes another private set in an oblivious way, and present an efficient OSID quantum protocol. Especially, in order to efficiently implement OSID quantum protocol, we design a single-photon-based quantum protocol for computing XOR of two private bits, which can achieve the information-theoretical security with the help of a non-colluding quantum cloud. Finally, we propose a novel quantum scheme for privacy-preserving range MAX/MIN query in edge-based Internet of Things by using OSID quantum protocols. Compared with the classical related schemes, our proposed quantum scheme has higher security (i.e., quantum security), because the security of our proposed protocols is based on the basic physical principles of quantum mechanics, instead of unproven computational difficulty assumptions.

When it comes to healthcare, cloud-based services may include fail-safes like disaster recovery and redundancy to protect against failures and lessen the impact of service interruptions. The health and wellness cloud is the central data repository that facilitates effective data access and sharing. Our system's PHE schemes and Re-encryption algorithms are based on the below group choice issue, different logarithms, and bi-linear enhancements. Due to the time-consuming decryption and memory-intensive re-encryption processes, system performance may suffer.We use a PHE system and a Re-encryption formula based on a combination of the sub-team-choice problem, separate logarithms, and bi-linear transformations in our system. Due to the time-consuming decryption process and the memory requirements of re-encryption, the system's efficiency may suffer. In order to enhance the accuracy of both prediction and protection, the AI principle has been combined with a variety of algorithmic perspectives, including as categorization and grouping, deep semantic network, and quantum semantic network. In addition to reducing phm strikes by an estimated 100 percent, the recommended designs also boost cloud customers' faith in the service and the bottom lines of cloud service providers (CSPs).

Fog Computing, an updated version of the cloud framework, utilizes a decentralized architecture to maintain data between the cloud and the data sources. This procedure seeks to improve performance, network connectivity, and most importantly provide security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is employed in fog computing architectures to develop and circulate keys. The employed keys change their quantum configurations, enabling them to be highly safe. Further, an intermediary maintaining the key can identify any endeavor by illegal entities to operate it.

Remarkably, we achieved 100% error correction accuracy on simulators and significant success rates on IBM hardware: 68.95% for error correction and 86.04% for error detection in 5-qubit systems. However, the Quantum Repetition Code (QRC) showed limitations in handling multiple-qubit errors in 5-qubit systems.

It aims to alleviate strain on the grid during high demand and promote a more balanced and efficient use of (renewable) electricity resources. We implement DSR through discount scheduling, which involves offering discrete price incentives to consumers to adjust their electricity consumption patterns to times when their local energy mix consists of more renewable energy. Since we tailor the discounts to individual customers' consumption, the discount scheduling problem (DSP) becomes a large combinatorial optimization task. Consequently, we adopt a hybrid quantum computing approach, using D-Wave's Leap Hybrid Cloud. We benchmark Leap against Gurobi, a classical mixed-integer optimizer, in terms of solution quality at fixed runtime and fairness in terms of discount allocation. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale decomposition algorithm/heuristic for the DSP, applied with either quantum or classical computers running the subroutines, which significantly reduces the problem size while maintaining solution quality. Using synthetic data generated from real-world data, we observe that the classical decomposition method obtains the best overall solution quality for problem sizes up to 3200 consumers; however, the hybrid quantum approach provides more evenly distributed discounts across consumers. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the most promising applications of quantum computing is the processing of graphical data like images. Here, we investigate the possibility of realizing a quantum pattern recognition protocol based on swap test, and use the IBMQ noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices to verify the idea. We find that with a two-qubit protocol, swap test can efficiently detect the similarity between two patterns with good fidelity, though for three or more qubits, the noise in the real devices becomes detrimental. To mitigate this noise effect, we resort to destructive swap test, which shows an improved performance for three-qubit states. Due to limited cloud access to larger IBMQ processors, we take a segment-wise approach to apply the destructive swap test on higher dimensional images. In this case, we define an average overlap measure which shows faithfulness to distinguish between two very different or very similar patterns when run on real IBMQ processors. As test images, we use binary images with simple patterns, grayscale MNIST numbers and fashion MNIST images, as well as binary images of human blood vessel obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We also present an experimental set up for applying destructive swap test using the nitrogen vacancy (NVs) center in diamond. Our experimental data show high fidelity for single qubit states.

	abstract = {The quantum cloud computing paradigm presents unique challenges in task placement due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of quantum computation resources. Traditional heuristic approaches fall short in adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of quantum computing. This paper proposes DRLQ, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)- based technique for task placement in quantum cloud computing environments, addressing the optimization of task completion time and quantum task scheduling efficiency. It leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture, enhanced with the Rainbow DQN approach, to create a dynamic task placement strategy. This approach is one of the first in the field of quantum cloud resource management, enabling adaptive learning and decision-making for quantum cloud environments and effectively optimizing task placement based on changing conditions and resource availability. We conduct extensive experiments using the QSimPy simulation toolkit to evaluate the performance of our method, demonstrating substantial improvements in task execution efficiency and a reduction in the need to reschedule quantum tasks. Our results show that utilizing the DRLQ approach for task placement can significantly reduce total quantum task completion time by 37.81 % to 72.93% and prevent task rescheduling attempts compared to other heuristic approaches.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Resource allocation plays a pivotal role in Cloud Computing (CC), significantly impacting its overall performance. In order to fairly spread workload among servers, network ports, and hard drives, task scheduling is a critical module of CC. Cloud computing experiences request overloading as a result of dynamic computing over the internet. To address this challenge, a novel Cloud based Load balancing using Quantum artificial bee colony Optimization Algorithm has been proposed for task scheduling that can significantly enhance the effectiveness of cloud computing operations. The technique focuses on two important aspects of cloud computing: resource allocation and task scheduling. By achieving load balancing between servers, the proposed CLUQOA (Cloud based Load balancing Using Quantum artificial bee colony Optimization Algorithm) improves reliability and lowers expenses, latency, and response times. To show how effective it is, key performance parameters including makespan, resource usage, task migration, task execution time, and response time are assessed. The results of comparative comparisons with other approaches, such as HUNTER (Holistic resoUrce maNagemenT technique for Energy-efficient cloud computing using aRtificial intelligence), FPNSO (Flower Pollination based Non-dominated Sorting Optimization), and ProHPA (Proactive Hybrid Pod Autoscaling), demonstrate the superiority of CLUQOA in terms of improving resource utilization (35.6%, 26.4%, and 13.9%, respectively) and reducing makespan (11.02%, 9.6%, and 10.4%, respectively). © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society).

As a solution, IBM Quantum (IBMQ) systems developed by IBM are accessed via the cloud. Although there are high qubit quantum backends currently offered for a fee, 5 and 7 qubit backends are publicly free. In this study, publicly free quantum backends in the IBM quantum experience environment are discussed. The study includes a comparative explanation of the factors affecting the performance of quantum computers. Quantum circuits were created in the IBM Composer environment and then run on the appropriate backend. Quantum circuits of 4mod5, which finds whether a 4-bit number is divisible by 5, 1-bitadder that performs 1-bit addition with the carry bit, and gray code, which finds the gray code equivalent of the binary number, were created. The created circuits were run on 8 different IBMQ backends and the results were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that while the simplicity of the gates used increases the performance rates, there may be different backends that operate each quantum circuit more accurately. It is hoped that the study will be a guide for researchers working on applied quantum computing.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Accurate workload prediction is identified as a crucial strategy to address these challenges. Despite numerous methods proposed to tackle this issue, existing approaches fall short of capturing the high-variance nature of volatile and dynamic cloud workloads. Consequently, this paper introduces a novel model aimed at addressing this limitation. This paper presents a novel Multiple Controlled Toffoli-driven Adaptive Quantum Neural Network (MCT-AQNN) model to establish an empirical solution to complex, elastic as well as challenging workload prediction problems by optimizing the exploration, adaption, and exploitation proficiencies through quantum learning. The computational adaptability of quantum computing is ingrained with machine learning algorithms to derive more precise correlations from dynamic and complex workloads. The furnished input data point and hatched neural weights are refitted in the form of qubits while the controlling effects of Multiple Controlled Toffoli (MCT) gates are operated at the hidden and output layers of Quantum Neural Network (QNN) for enhancing learning capabilities. Complimentarily, a Uniformly Adaptive Quantum Machine Learning (UAQL) algorithm has evolved to functionally and effectually train the QNN. The extensive experiments are conducted and the comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art methods using four real-world benchmark datasets. Experimental results evince that MCT-AQNN has up to 32&#x0025;-96&#x0025; higher accuracy than the existing approaches. IEEE},

	abstract = {Security and reliability are primary concerns in any computing paradigm, including quantum computing. Currently, users can access quantum computers through a cloud-based platform where they can run their programs on a suite of quantum computers. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect that more companies including untrusted/less-trusted/unreliable vendors will begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at varied price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue could be long, the users will be motivated to use the cheaper and readily available but unreliable/less-trusted hardware. The less-trusted vendors can tamper with the results, providing a sub-optimal solution to the user. For applications such as, critical infrastructure optimization, the inferior solution may have significant socio-political implications. Since quantum computers cannot be simulated in classical computers, users have no way of verifying the computation outcome. In this paper, we address this challenge by modeling adversarial tampering and simulating it's impact on both pure quantum and hybrid quantum-classical workloads. To achieve trustworthy computing in a mixed environment of trusted and untrusted hardware, we propose an equitable distribution of total shots (i.e., repeated executions of quantum programs) across hardware options. On average, we note ≈ 30X and ≈ 1.5X improvement across the pure quantum workloads and a maximum improvement of ≈ 5X for hybrid-classical algorithm in the chosen quality metrics. We also propose an intelligent run adaptive shot distribution heuristic leveraging temporal variation in hardware quality to user's advantage, allowing them to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more number of shots to the reliable hardware, which results in a maximum improvement of ≈ 190X and ≈ 9X across the pure quantum workloads and an improvement of up to ≈ 2.5X for hybrid-classical algorithm.

	abstract = {The increasing focus on privacy and security in 6G networks, which are intelligence-native, necessitates the use of quantum key distribution-secured semantic information communication (QKD-SIC) to protect confidential data. In QKD-SIC systems, edge devices connected via quantum channels can efficiently encrypt semantic information from the semantic source, and securely transmit the encrypted semantic information to the semantic destination. In this article, we consider an efficient resource (i.e., quantum key distribution (QKD) and KM wavelengths) sharing problem to support QKD-SIC systems under the uncertainty of semantic information generated by edge devices. In such a system, QKD service providers offer QKD services with different subscription options to the edge devices. The QKD services are envisioned to follow cloud computing that has the subscription in the reservation and on-demand options, i.e., for long and short (immediate) terms, respectively. As such, to reduce the cost for the edge device users, we propose a QKD resource management framework for the edge devices communicating semantic information. The framework is based on a two-stage stochastic optimization model to achieve optimal QKD deployment. Moreover, to reduce the deployment cost of QKD service providers, QKD resources in the proposed framework can be utilized based on efficient QKD-SIC resource management, including semantic information transmission among edge devices, secret-key provisioning, and cooperation formation among QKD service providers. In detail, the formulated two-stage stochastic optimization model can achieve the optimal QKD-SIC resource deployment while meeting the secret-key requirements for semantic information transmission of edge devices. Moreover, to share the cost of the QKD resource pool among cooperative QKD service providers forming a coalition in a fair and interpretable manner, the proposed framework leverages the concept of Shapley value from cooperative game theory as a solution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can reduce the deployment cost by about 40% compared with existing noncooperative baselines.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Datacenter networks (DCNs) with cloud-edge collaboration are emerging to satisfy the communication, computation, and caching (3C) requirements of future services such as cloud-based IoT services. However, the enroute data over DCNs with cloud-edge collaboration is likely to suffer from cyberattacks such as eavesdropping. A large number of services require not only 3C resources, but also cryptographic resources for encryption to ensure high security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a practical approach to provide secret keys for remote users with information-theoretic security against attacks from quantum computing. A QKD-secured DCN (QKD-DCN) with cloud-edge collaboration can be deployed to satisfy the communication, computation, caching, and cryptographic (4C) requirements of services. This article innovatively solves the new 4C resource-allocation (4CRA) problem in the network to minimize the cryptographic resource consumption. It formulates an integer linear programming (ILP) model and proposes a heuristic cryptographic-dependent 4CRA algorithm to find optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline 4CRA algorithms which, respectively, consider the minimized service delivery latency and the first-fit resource availability. Analytical simulations show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the key-resource-consumption ratio and the average key-resource consumption under static and dynamic traffic scenarios in different network topologies.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud Computing enables multiple users to access a network of computing resources. To satisfy the expectations of cloud providers and consumers, it has become more focused on delivering Quality of Service (QoS). QoS is geared towards reducing task completion time, also referred to as makespan, and response time, while enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization. To achieve QoS, novel task scheduling strategies are employed, as traditional schedulers have often failed to meet the required standards. Several schedulers have prioritized reducing waiting or response times, without considering the impact on specific processes. To meet QoS requirements, new task scheduling techniques are frequently utilized. This article proposes the FSRmSTS task scheduling algorithm, which combines First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), and Round Robin (RR) with Median Standard Time Slice schedulers. In order to balance waiting times for both short and long tasks, it uses a dynamic task quantum. It also splits the ready queue into two sub-queues according to task duration. Tasks are assigned to resources from each sub-queue in a mutually exclusive manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm was evaluated using the CloudSim environment toolkit 3.0.3 and compared against six other scheduling algorithms, namely FCFS, SJF, RR, Improved RR, HFSR (Hybrid First Come First Serve, Shortest job first, Round Robin), and HFSR with Median. The results revealed that FSRmSTS outperformed the other algorithms by reducing waiting and turnaround time, and addressing the issue of long task starvation. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.},

This begs the question of which device excels at which tasks and how to compare these different quantum devices with one another. The answer is given by quantum metrics, of which many exist today already. Different metrics focus on different aspects of (quantum) devices and choosing the right metric to benchmark one device against another is a difficult choice. In this paper, we aim to give an overview of this zoo of metrics by grouping established metrics in three levels: component level, system level and application level. With this characterization, we also mention what the merits and uses are for each of the different levels. In addition, we evaluate these metrics on the Starmon-5 device of Quantum Inspire through the cloud access, giving the most complete benchmark of a quantum device from an user experience to date. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing enables developers to deploy and host applications without focusing on installing and maintaining the infrastructure. The developers can utilize the services provided by the cloud service providers (CSPs) to offer scalable solutions to customer applications. As a result, CSPs are deluged with different batches of cloudlets (tasks) from diverse customer applications. Therefore, developing an algorithm that selects and processes applications intelligently to minimize the execution time and maximize the throughput becomes challenging. Many researchers have shown the round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm variants to tackle this problem. One such variant is the dynamic RR heuristic algorithm (DRRHA) that utilizes the mean of the burst times (BTs) of cloudlets in the ready queue (RQ) to calculate the time quantum (TQ). However, DRRHA has not considered skewness. This paper introduces a novel skewness-based RR algorithm (SRRA) for cloudlet scheduling. The algorithm dynamically determines the TQ for each cloudlet based on the skewness of the BTs of cloudlets in the RQ. The algorithm has two variants: SRRA with minimum TQ (SRRA-Min) and SRRA with median TQ (SRRA-Med). The two variants of the proposed algorithm exhibit improved performance in terms of total execution time (TET) and throughput compared to DRRHA, individually and collectively. These comparisons are conducted using CloudSim Plus under two scenarios: constant skewness with varying cloudlets and constant cloudlets with varying skewness.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The role of random numbers in such applications is to add the necessary entropy to produce secure keys that protect data, to select data for training and testing machine learning models, or to improve the efficiency of solution space searches in evolutionary algorithms and heuristic methods. The available software methods can only generate pseudo-random numbers, while conventional hardware methods extract randomness from the environment, and these physical processes possess specific self-similar patterns. In contrast, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) produce truly random numbers by exploiting the randomness of quantum state measurement. Software platforms that provide random numbers over the cloud, rendered with network-attached quantum random number generator devices, exist; however, they were not developed as a native C language solution for embedded applications. Therefore, we introduce libqrng, written in C, which offers access to IDQ's Quantis Appliance high-quality random numbers through an easy-to-integrate API for embedded and distributed computing applications that requires randomness and an interface for using the library from different programming languages (e.g., Python). © 2024 The Authors},

This tendency has heightened global competition and demanded firms' regional development for their continued viability. For these criteria to be met, it is required to efficiently employ resources in pursuit of operational excellence. In the context of cloud computing (CC), task scheduling is a key research topic. Task scheduling is an approach that employs an efficient algorithm to map client tasks to appropriate and accessible virtualized resources. Since CC is a distributed and scalable realm, it is more difficult to schedule work. Therefore, an effective approach to work scheduling is required since it is regarded as vital for system performance. Traditional algorithms including round-robin (RR), first come first serve (FCFS), largest job first (LJF), and shortest job first (SJF). To enhance the RR algorithm, several researchers have concentrated on choosing a suitable quantum time and provided a variety of approaches. Several researchers use Cloudsim to model CC infrastructure and applications. This review is intended to explore further because there are still many problems that will be corrected and resolved in further research. This paper can be a valuable resource for researchers who want to improve or develop RR or implement it in CC or various other related fields.  © 2023 IEEE.},

However, stringent operational requirements render quantum computing devices inherently costly. To democratize access to quantum computers, efforts have been made to make these devices accessible via cloud platforms. This has led to multiple users gaining access to the same quantum computers sequentially through cloud-based interfaces. However, quantum computers today are susceptible to noise, which causes computational errors. Compounded with widespread user access, this susceptibility opens avenues for side-channel threats within quantum computing systems, where malicious users may exploit these vulnerabilities to intercept and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

	abstract = {Dempster rule of combination is a powerful combination tool. It has been widely used in many fields, such as information fusion and decision-making. However, the computational complexity of Dempster rule of combination increases exponentially with the increase of frame of discernment. To address this issue, leveraging the parallel advantage of quantum computing, we present a quantum algorithm of Dempster rule of combination. The new method includes four steps. First, the quantum superposition states corresponding to arbitrary mass functions are prepared. Next, the superposition states corresponding to the two mass functions are combined by the tensor product. Effective qubits are then measured. Finally, the measurement results are normalized to obtain the combined results. The new method not only realizes most of the functions of Dempster rule of combination, but also effectively reduces the computational complexity of Dempster rule of combination in the quantum computer. Finally, we carry out the simulation experiments on the quantum cloud platform of IBM, and the experimental results show that the new method is reasonable. Compared with the traditional combination rule, this method effectively reduces the computational complexity. As the frame of discernment becomes larger, the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of running time become larger and larger. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has become widely available to researchers via cloud-hosted devices with different technologies using a multitude of software development frameworks. The vertical stack behind such solutions typically features quantum language abstraction and high-level translation frameworks that tend to be open source, down to pulse-level programming. However, the lower-level mapping to the control electronics, such as controls for laser and microwave pulse generators, remains closed source for contemporary commercial cloud-hosted quantum devices. One exception is the ARTIQ (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics) open-source library for trapped-ion control electronics. This stack has been complemented by the Duke ARTIQ Extensions (DAX) to provide modularity and better abstraction. It, however, remains disconnected from the wealth of features provided by popular quantum computing languages. This paper contributes QisDAX, a bridge between Qiskit and DAX that fills this gap. QisDAX provides interfaces for Python programs written using IBM's Qiskit and transpiles them to the DAX abstraction. This allows users to generically interface to the ARTIQ control systems accessing trapped-ion quantum devices. Consequently, the algorithms expressed in Qiskit become available to an open-source quantum software stack. This provides the first open-source, end-to-end, full-stack pipeline for remote submission of quantum programs for trapped-ion quantum systems in a non-commercial setting. © 2023 IEEE.},

Leveraging the unique properties of multiple quantum degrees of freedom, this protocol expands the channel capacity and enhances transmission efficiency. Compared to previous measurement-device-independent quantum dialogue (MDI-QD) protocols, this protocol not only further improves transmission efficiency but also enables mutual authentication between correspondents, effectively defending against the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.

As modern quantum computers become increasingly hard to simulate, we must develop accurate and scalable predictive capability models to help researchers and stakeholders decide which quantum computers to build and use. In this work, we propose a hardware-agnostic method to efficiently construct scalable predictive models of a quantum computer's capability for almost any class of circuits and demonstrate our method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our CNN-based approach works by efficiently representing a circuit as a 3-D tensor and then using a CNN to predict its success rate. Our CNN capability models obtain approximately a 1% average absolute prediction error when modeling processors experiencing both Markovian and non-Markovian stochastic Pauli errors. We also apply our CNNs to model the capabilities of cloud-access quantum computing systems, obtaining moderate prediction accuracy (average absolute error around 2-5%), and we highlight the challenges to building better neural network capability models.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As cloud quantum computing gains broader acceptance, a growing quantity of researchers are directing their focus towards this domain. Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

In this paper, we make the first attempt, to our best knowledge, to apply an SI&EA, Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), for addressing the task scheduling problem in Device-Edge-Cloud Cooperative Computing (DE3C) which is one of the most widespread and new computing paradigms. We first formulate the problem and propose a QPSO based method to solve the problem with a reasonable time. Then we summarize the existing variants of QPSO, which exploit various improvement schemes for QPSO. At last, we conduct simulated experiments to evaluate the performance of QPSO and its variants on solving the task scheduling problem of DE3C, and have the following findings. (1) QPSO outperforms several up-to-date heuristics and SI&EAs in both the user satisfaction and the resource efficiency. (2) Existing improvement methods have no appreciable effect on QPSO for solving large-scale problems. (3) The performance of an improvement for QPSO depends mostly on randomness of the offset added to particle movements. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has regenerated how processing infrastructure is abstracted and used as a significant architecture for large-scale computation. In addition to the issues posed by Big Data storage, the rapid growth of cloud computing increases the complexity of data confidentiality, data security, and user access regulations, resulting in a loss of cloud service trustworthiness. The country and society rely heavily on its security. We introduce a new, improved NTRU cryptosystem that raises an alert whenever it detects quantum computing attacks to extract spatial and temporal features. A Spatio-temporal constrained Secure and Verifiable Attribute-Based Access Control Scheme (SSVAABAC) is proposed in this research. This method’s primary purpose is to successfully update and check access policies to improve authorization flexibility, resource usage, and business timeliness. On the one hand, INTRU cryptosystem and Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Schemes are combined to improve the efficiency of security strength in cloud servers and provide efficient access policies enforced access decisions without adding any permission. It is easier to modify attributes than to change or define new roles in cloud servers by data owners, resulting in less computational overhead than traditional methods. On the other hand, the developed SSVA-ACS will support temporal and spatial constrained attributes to enable the user’s accessibility of cypher text from CSs associated with the location and valid time interval. The effectiveness of decryption is successful if the Access policies and Spatio-temporal details of users satisfy data owners’ detail. Thus, the proposed scheme fits the user secret key for the users specified in the location and time interval. As a result, a concrete structure implements the suggested technique by implementing an encryption device that associates a user’s time-related privilege with the current access time. The final results show that the SVACS and ABAC are more effective than the SSVAACS. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing offers a potentially powerful new method for performing machine learning. However, several quantum machine learning techniques have been shown to exhibit poor generalisation as the number of qubits increases. We address this issue by demonstrating a permutation invariant quantum encoding method, which exhibits superior generalisation performance, and apply it to point cloud data (three-dimensional images composed of points). Point clouds naturally contain permutation symmetry with respect to the ordering of their points, making them a natural candidate for this technique. Our method captures this symmetry in a quantum encoding that contains an equal quantum superposition of all permutations and is therefore invariant under point order permutation. We test this encoding method in numerical simulations using a quantum support vector machine to classify point clouds drawn from either spherical or toroidal geometries. We show that a permutation invariant encoding improves in accuracy as the number of points contained in the point cloud increases, while non-invariant quantum encodings decrease in accuracy. This demonstrates that by implementing permutation invariance into the encoding, the model exhibits improved generalisation. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In the current conception of the computing continuum, such computational resources are spread in the infrastructure from the Cloud to the Edge and the tasks are mapped on resources following placing and replacing strategies. In this scope, this paper puts together two emergent paradigms. On the one hand, the emergence of the Quantum Computation paradigm will allow these intensive systems to incorporate specific tasks that are unaffordable by classic computers. On the other hand, the liquid software model proposes a fluid movement of the software and information from one device to another. Therefore, in this paper, we present a broad overview of software-intensive systems from a liquid software perspective and support quantum functionalities in their processes. To provide a better understanding of how these systems can take form, we explore a case study based on weather forecasts. ©2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a significant technology domain, primarily due to the emergence of big data, machine learning, and quantum computing applications. While earlier, cloud computing services were focused mainly on providing storage and some infrastructures/platforms for applications, the need to advance computational power analysis of massive datasets. It has made cloud computing almost inevitable from most client-based applications, mobile applications, or web applications. The allied challenge to protect data shared from and to cloud-based platforms has cropped up with the necessity to access public clouds. While conventional cryptographic algorithms have been used for securing and authenticating cloud data, advancements in cryptanalysis and access to faster computation have led to possible threats to the traditional security of cloud mechanisms. This has led to extensive research in homomorphic encryption pertaining to cloud security. In this paper, a security mechanism is designed targeted towards dynamic groups using public clouds. Cloud security mechanisms generally face a significant challenge in terms of overhead, throughput, and execution time to encrypt data from dynamic groups with frequent member addition and removal. A two-stage homomorphic encryption process is proposed for data security in this paper. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the salient cryptographic metrics, which are the avalanche effect, throughput, and execution time. A comparative analysis with conventional cryptographic algorithms shows that the proposed system outperforms them regarding the cryptographic performance metrics. © 2022 Sheenal Malviya et al., published by Sciendo.},

	abstract = {Spectral clustering, a powerful algorithm in the field of AI, holds a significant role despite its inherent high time complexity. For data owners grappling with limitations such as small datasets and restricted computational resources, harnessing the computational capabilities of cloud computing and aggregating data from multiple sources can yield precise spectral clustering results. However, explicit data uploading to cloud servers poses privacy risks. In response to this challenge, we explore the outsourcing dilemma of spectral clustering in a cloud and multi-user environment and propose a quantum-secure and efficient solution. Specifically, by employing the CKKS homomorphic encryption algorithm within a dual non-collusive server model, we formulate a comprehensive and multi-user spectral clustering outsourcing scheme. Our approach addresses privacy concerns by introducing secure computation protocols for L2 norm, exponential function, and negative half power function. We elaborate on efficient computational algorithms for each stage of spectral clustering, ensuring accurate clustering outcomes without compromising dataset privacy. Moreover, in our scheme, users only need to upload their encrypted dataset without requiring direct interaction with each other or the cloud server until obtaining clustering results. Finally, we argue the IND-CPA security of our design and substantiate its accuracy and efficiency through theoretical comparison analysis and experimental evaluations.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The motivation is to explore the potential of Quantum Computing assisted cybersecurity for Security-by-Design (SbD) of Industrial-Internet-of-Things (IIoT). Internet-of-Things (IoT) in Industry 4.0 can improve efficiency, increase automation, and facilitate intelligent decision making through the integration of edge cloud computing paradigms. However, the lack of standardization of security protocols across IIoT devices can be challenging due to the heterogeneous nature of these devices. In this context, a novel Quantum circuits based PUF design that is built on real Quantum hardware is presented. The proposed QPUF can facilitate security in IIoT by using a Quantum hardware generated PUF key as the device identity. The proposed PUF Design is built using Quantum Hadamard Gate, and Ry gates and has been experimentally demonstrated on IBM Quantum hardware systems. The proposed architecture also supports PUF key generation from Quantum hardware for security applications. Figures-of-merits (FoM) of PUF have been evaluated and presented to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed Quantum PUF for SbD of IIoT. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The ability for users to access quantum computers through the cloud has increased rapidly in recent years. Despite still being Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines, modern quantum computers are now being actively employed for research and by numerous startups. Quantum algorithms typically produce probabilistic results, necessitating repeated execution to produce the desired outcomes. In order for the execution to begin from the specified ground state each time and for the results of the prior execution not to interfere with the results of the subsequent execution, the reset mechanism must be performed between each iteration to effectively reset the qubits. However, due to noise and errors in quantum computers and specifically these reset mechanisms, a noisy reset operation may lead to systematic errors in the overall computation, as well as potential security and privacy vulnerabilities of information leakage. To counter this issue, we thoroughly examine the state leakage problem in quantum computing, and then propose a solution by employing the classical and quantum one-time pads before the reset mechanism to prevent the state leakage, which works by randomly applying simple gates for each execution of the circuit. In addition, this work explores conditions under which the classical one-time pad, which uses fewer resources, is sufficient to protect state leakage. Finally, we study the role of various errors in state leakage, by evaluating the degrees of leakage under different error levels of gate, measurement, and sampling errors. Our findings offer new perspectives on the design of reset mechanisms and secure quantum computing systems. © 2024 IEEE.},

However, cloud-based quantum services provide convenience while also introducing security risks. For example, attackers could steal private information or inject malicious programs into quantum devices, while quantum device fingerprinting may be the first step for these malicious intents. In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Driven Quantum Device Fingerprinting (TD-QDF) identification method based on quantum neural network (QNN) task outcomes. Unlike previous research, our method does not require any hardware details, resulting in high availability in practice. Extensive experiments involving 3 QNN circuits on 10 real IBM quantum computers show that our method can effectively identify quantum devices.

	abstract = {In the dynamic field of quantum computing, characterized by constant innovation and continuous advancement of hardware and software capabilities, it is clear that this emerging technology holds immense potential in fields such as medicine and security. However, as the quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers. In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance, and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6% when the load balancer is employed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {In recent years, cloud storage services have risen widely, and how to ensure the integrity of outsourced data in cloud setting catches more and more attention. Kinds of integrity auditing protocols, additionally attaching tags on original data file, have been proposed. In order to compress the storage and communication overheads, Yang et al. presented a compressive auditing technique, which is identity-based and quantum computing resistant. Note that Yang et al. also claimed that their protocol is “suitable” for outsourcing auditing process to third party auditor (TPA). However, in this paper, we first pointed out that Yang et al.’s compressive protocol is essentially private auditing since the data owner needs to confidential transmit secret value to TPA. In fact, if TPA shares this value to cloud service provider (CSP), then Yang et al.’s scheme will become completely insecure. Then, we propose a new identity-based protocol, which is based on lattice and thus still secure in future quantum computing. Meanwhile, our proposed protocol belongs to public auditing instead of private auditing. Finally, we analyze the performance of our proposed protocol, which shows that it is competitive in the cloud storage applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

A significant number of research scientists primarily rely on cloud computing infrastructures while conducting research, whereas access to real (mostly remote) quantum hardware resources requires the deployment and proper configuration of different software components. In this paper we present a hybrid, cloud-based reference architecture that lowers the entry barrier to start new experiments with a wide range of quantum compute resources. The solution facilitates the execution of distributed quantum computing simulations in traditional cloud environments, and also access to several remote quantum compute resources. The reference architecture is highly portable to various cloud platforms, resulting in efficient adaptation and application possibilities by research communities.

This enthusiasm has resulted in ambitious growth plans which stimulate the development of more efficient quantum computing devices and programming environments. The easy accessibility of quantum platforms in the cloud has attracted individuals to explore quantum computing, prompting a comprehensive analysis and assessment of quantum device's behavior. The extensive benchmarking presented in this study involved all free available quantum computing devices within the IBM Quantum Platform. These devices are employed to execute tens of thousands of quantum program executions, with the objective of evaluating quantum computer behavior and performance over time and under different optimization options. Special emphasis has been placed on analyzing the transpile operation and the depth of generated quantum circuits. The machine analysis tests are conducted using Quantum Computing Run Assistant (QCRA), a versatile software tool specifically designed to streamline the effortless distribution of quantum programs across a range of quantum computing platforms.

	abstract = {The rapid development of cloud computing and the exponential growth of data have led to an increasing demand for secure data sharing and querying. Proxy re-encryption (PRE) addresses the issue of secure data sharing, since it enables controlled data sharing and delegation of access rights without revealing the actual content of the encrypted data stored in the cloud; public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) tackles the issue of secure data querying, since it allows resource-constrained clients to effectively search over encrypted data stored in the cloud. As a combination of PRE and PEKS, proxy re-encryption with keyword search (PRES) enables both secure data sharing and querying. Despite their merits, existing PRES schemes are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks, keyword guessing attacks (KGAs), or incur high end-to-end delay. To address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a novel cryptographic primitive called public-key authenticated re-encryption with keyword search (Re-PAEKS), which combines the strengths of PRE and public-key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS). Our Re-PAEKS has low end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and KGAs. Technically, we improve the previous lattice-based PAEKS scheme and achieve the delegation of access rights by exploiting the lattice-based identity-based encryption (IBE) techniques, which are widely believed to be secure against quantum computer attacks. In addition, we formalize the security model of the Re-PAEKS and prove its security in the random oracle model. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the Re-PAEKS, and the experimental results show that the Re-PAEKS is computationally efficient and practical. Particularly, the Re-PAEKS enjoys the lowest end-to-end delay compared to current state-of-the-art PRES.  © 2024 IEEE.

	abstract = {Cloud computing (CC) is a typical paradigm that maintains, manages, and backs up statistics remotely using dynamic capabilities. It allows consumers and companies to access services on demand and as needed across a web network, and it increases the capabilities of physical resources by maximizing and sharing their utilisation. Cloud computing performance can be harmed by inefficient resource management. As a result, resources must be distributed fairly among many stakeholders without jeopardizing the organization's profit or user happiness. Information security and privacy, on the other hand, have surfaced as a major worry threatening CC's success. To begin with, storing data on the cloud increases the risk of data leakage and unauthorised access. Second, cyber-attacks and disruptions are increasingly targeting cloud systems, posing a danger to cloud security. It's It is a requirement for the advancement of distributed computing. As a consequence, in this paper, a hybrid task-based security method has been developed. A secure and safe environment for distributed computing operations has been built using the improved Cat Swarm algorithm for Task Scheduling with Quantum Key Distribution ICSTS-QKDP for CC, which employs quality-based encryption. To begin, an improved cat swarm optimization algorithm-based short scheduler for task scheduling (ICSTS) reduces make-span time while increasing throughput. The suggested design provides cloud users peace of mind when it comes to data security. Quantum Key Distribution Protocol (QKDP) incorporates quantum key cryptography to provide cloud storage security and control data dynamics. A large quantity of data is collected from a variety of computing devices in the distributed computing paradigm, which may be monitored and limited by the framework. The strategy is primarily concerned with data access, storage, and management. The secured keys are transferred across a trusted channel when the model is used. The suggested approach outperforms the present one in terms of resource usage, energy consumption, reaction time, secure key transfer, and so on. Its goal is to prevent unauthorised client access and ensure that only authorised clients have access to the same data. © 2024, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Accurate early identification and treatment of cardiovascular diseases can prevent heart failure problems and reduce mortality rates. This study aims to use quantum learning to predict heart problems to increase the accuracy of traditional prediction and classification methods. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques need quantum learning to quickly and accurately analyze massive volumes of complex data. With quantum computing, the suggested DL and ML algorithms can change their predictions on the basis of changes in the dataset. This approach could help with the early and accurate detection of chronic diseases. The Cleveland heart disease dataset is undergoing preliminary processing to validate missing values to increase the precision rate and prevent incorrect forecasts. This study examined the feasibility of employing and deploying a quantum ML (QML) framework via cloud computing to categorize cardiac conditions. The research was divided into four sections. First, the principal component analysis was used to preprocess the Cleveland dataset, recursive feature elimination was used to select features, and min-max normalization was used to give the dataset a high-dimensional value. Second, we compared traditional classifiers, such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network, with the quantum approach to verify the quantum approach's efficiency. Third, we examined two unique QML classification methods: quantum neural networks (QNNs) and quantum SVM (QSVM). Fourth, bagging-QSVM was developed and deployed as an ensemble learning model. Experimental results using the QNN show an accuracy of 77%, a precision of 76%, a recall of 73%, and an F1 score of 75%. With an accuracy of 85%, a precision of 79%, a recall of 90%, and an F1-score of 84%, the QSVM method demonstrated a much better performance than the QNN. Particularly, the Bagging_QSVM model exhibited an outstanding performance, with a flawless score of 100% across all critical performance measures. The study shows that the bagging method for ensemble learning is a solid way of increasing the accuracy of quantum method predictions. © 2024 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {The integration of Quantum Computers (QC) within High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments holds significant promise for solving real-world problems by leveraging the strengths of both computational paradigms. However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services.

Any disturbance or tampering of information on quantum bits will be easily detectable by the rules of quantum mechanics. This is an essential property and can be utilized in quantum communication. In free space communication, photon polarization and quantum key distribution (QKD) secure the information. However, noise, such as channel and circuit noise, also disturbs flawless communication. This research thoroughly studies a single photon-based protocol, BB84 in its ideal state and injected with noises. The objective of the paper is to induce parametrized noise to observe the effect in various cloud platforms with three different simulators, IBM QASM, CDAC QSim, and AWS Braket. Next, it presents a comprehensive study of the simulation of parametrized noise, bit flip, with the detailed setup and characteristics of these simulators.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the drive to create a decentralized digital economy, Web 3.0 has become a cornerstone of digital transformation, developed on the basis of computing power networks, distributed data storage, and blockchain. With the rapid realization of quantum devices, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with the advantages of quantum computing and communication. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 framework that provides information-theoretic security for decentralized data transferring and payment transactions. First, we present the framework of quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 with futureproof security during the transmission of data and transaction information. Next, we discuss the potential applications and challenges of implementing quantum blockchain in Web 3.0. Finally, we describe a use case for quantum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and propose a quantum deep learning-based optimal auction for NFT trading to maximize the achievable revenue for sufficient liquidity in Web 3.0. In this way, the proposed framework can achieve proven security and sustainability for the next-generation decentralized digital society.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Because of the Internet’s phenomenal growth in recent years, computing resources are now more widely available. It led to the development of a new computing concept known as Cloud Computing, allowing users to share resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications, services, software, and data across multiple devices on demand for economical and fast. Load balancing is an important branch of cloud computing as it optimizes machine utilization by distributing tasks equally over resources. It occurs among physical hosts or Virtual Machines in a cloud environment. Round robin is a commonly used algorithm in load balancing. RR gives a time quantum for each task and is in circular order. It is noted that it suffers from many problems, such as the waste of time and the high cost. In the present study, the greedy algorithm was enhanced and implemented to allocate and schedule tasks that come to the cloud on Virtual Machines in balance. The task with the longest execution time is given to the virtual machine with the least load using an improved greedy algorithm. The outcomes demonstrate that the suggested algorithm outperformed round robin in makespan. Also, all Virtual Machines in the proposed algorithm finish their work simultaneously, whereas round robin is unbalanced. © Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.},

In this scenario, it is important to reduce the amount of quantum communication between the client and the server. A possible approach is to transform the desired computation into a compressed version that acts on a smaller number of qubits, thereby reducing the amount of data exchanged between the client and the server. Here we propose quantum autoencoders for quantum gates (QAEGate) as a method for compressing quantum computations. We illustrate it in concrete scenarios of single-round and multi-round communication and validate it through numerical experiments.

One of the challenging research problems of this point in time is to reduce the energy consumption in cloud data centres which leads motivation of green cloud computing. This article presents an energy efficient improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) to provide optimal solution for NP-hard task scheduling problems in cloud computing. An adjustable quantum rotation gate operator with adaptively dynamic adjustment of the rotation angle is developed according to the evolutionary generations and change in fitness values in each generation which serves as a major operation to update the population of the conventional QEA. The efficiency and accuracy of proposed QEA are greatly improved to measure the energy efficiency, makespan and resource utilisation in heterogeneous CC environment. Simulation results of the CloudSim shows that proposed QEA is superior to traditional PSO and GA to solve NP-hard task scheduling problems in green CC.

	abstract = {Multicontrolled unitary gates have been a subject of interest in quantum computing since their conception and are widely used in quantum algorithms. The current state-of-the-art approach to implementing n -qubit multicontrolled gates with a single target without relying on auxiliary qubits or approximate results involves the use of a quadratic number of single-qubit and CNOT gates. However, linear solutions are possible for the case where the controlled gate is special unitary, SU(2). The decomposition of an n -qubit multicontrolled SU(2) gate requires a circuit with a number of CNOT gates proportional to 28n. In this work, we present a new decomposition of n -qubit multicontrolled SU(2) gates that require a circuit with a number of CNOT gates proportional to 20n and proportional to 16n if the SU(2) gate has at least one real-valued diagonal. The proposed algorithms produce the most efficient known circuits and improve the existing algorithm by reducing the number of CNOT gates and the overall circuit depth. As an application, we show the use of this decomposition for sparse quantum state preparation. Our results are further validated by demonstrating a proof of principle on a quantum device accessed through quantum cloud services.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The processing of scientific workflow (SW) in geo-distributed cloud computing holds significant importance in the placement of massive data between various tasks. However, data movement across storage services is a main concern in the geo-distributed data centers, which entails issues related to the cost and energy consumption of both storage services and network infrastructure. Aiming to optimize data placement for SW, this paper proposes EQGSA-DPW a novel algorithm leveraging quantum computing and swarm intelligence optimization to intelligently reduce costs and energy consumption when a SW is processed in multi-cloud. EQGSA-DPW considers multiple objectives (e.g., transmission bandwidth, cost and energy consumption of both service and communication) and improves the GSA algorithm by using the log-sigmoid transfer function as a gravitational constant G and updating agent position by quantum rotation angle amplitude for more diversification. Moreover, to assist EQGSA-DPW in finding the optima, an initial guess is proposed. The performance of our EQGSA-DPW algorithm is evaluated via extensive experiments, which show that our data placement method achieves significantly better performance in terms of cost, energy, and data transfer than competing algorithms. For instance, in terms of energy consumption, EQGSA-DPW can on average achieve up to 25%, 14%, and 40% reduction over that of GSA, PSO, and ACO-DPDGW algorithms, respectively. As for the storage services cost, EQGSA-DPW values are the lowest. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

This is especially challenging in classification operations with high dimensional data input. Motivated by this, a novel stereoscopic 3D scalable QCNN (sQCNN-3D) is proposed for point cloud data processing in classification applications. Furthermore, reverse fidelity training (RF-Train) is additionally considered on top of sQCNN-3D for diversifying features with a limited number of qubits using the fidelity of quantum computing. Our data-intensive performance evaluation verifies that the proposed algorithm achieves desired performance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Driven by cloud computing technologies, public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is becoming a common practice from aspects of the Industrial Internet of Things, smart healthcare, vehicular social networks, and so on. However, a dozen years of PEKS development is accompanied by some security and privacy issues in the encrypted data search and access processes. The keyword guessing attack is a typical user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user's retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger key size. To the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum-resist PEKS scheme established on elliptic curve cryptography. This article utilizes PEKS with designated tester primitive and quantum resistance of isogeny. Then, we put forward a postquantum searchable encryption scheme named Isoga, which fights against keyword guessing attacks. We prove Isoga's searchable ciphertext security and trapdoor indistinguishability under isogeny-related difficult assumptions. Performance evaluation indicates that the Isoga scheme is more practical in the quantum environment, considering seven schemes' security properties, communication cost, and computing overload among.  © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

The optimal assignment and scheduling of computation on the different nodes is a very difficult problem, with NP-hard complexity. In this article, we explore the possibility of solving this problem with variational quantum algorithms, which can become a viable alternative to classical algorithms in the near future. In particular, we compare the performance, in terms of success probability, of two algorithms, i.e., quantum approximate optimization algorithm and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The simulation experiments, performed for a set of simple problems, show that the VQE algorithm ensures better performance when it is equipped with appropriate circuit ansatzes that are able to restrict the search space. Moreover, experiments executed on real quantum hardware show that the execution time, when increasing the size of the problem, grows much more slowly than the trend obtained with classical computation, which is known to be exponential.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The KREG and pKREG models were proven to enable accurate learning of multidimensional single-molecule surfaces of quantum chemical properties such as ground-state potential energies, excitation energies, and oscillator strengths. These models are based on kernel ridge regression (KRR) with the Gaussian kernel function and employ a relative-to-equilibrium (RE) global molecular descriptor, while pKREG is designed to enforce invariance under atom permutations with a permutationally invariant kernel. Here we extend these two models to also explicitly include the derivative information from the training data into the models, which greatly improves their accuracy. We demonstrate on the example of learning potential energies and energy gradients that KREG and pKREG models are better or on par with state-of-the-art machine learning models. We also found that in challenging cases both energy and energy gradient labels should be learned to properly model potential energy surfaces and learning only energies or gradients is insufficient.

As it is with classical networking, a simulation ecosystem allows for application development, standardization, and overall community building. Currently, there is limited traction towards building a quantum networking community-there are limited open-source platforms, challenging frameworks with steep learning curves, and strong requirements of software engineering skills. Our Quantum Network Development Kit (QNDK) project aims to solve these issues. It includes a graphical user interface to easily develop and run quantum network simulations with very little code. It integrates various quantum network simulation engines and provides a single interface to them, allowing users to use the features from any of them. Further, it deploys simulation execution in a cloud environment, offloading strong computing requirements to a high-performance computing system.

	abstract = {Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is 39% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Optimal task scheduling in 6G networks plays a crucial role in enabling a wide range of applications such as augmented reality, virtual reality, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things (IoT). With the network landscape becoming a more complex and diverse ecosystem, it is critical to advance conventional scheduling algorithms in order to guarantee the necessary efficiency and performance. In this regard, quantum computing can significantly speed up search for optimal schedules, increase the likelihood of finding optimal solutions, and facilitate the creation of correlations between tasks in a scheduling problem by virtue of parallelism, superposition, and entanglement. In this paper, we explore the variational quantum computing approach to tackle the complex task scheduling problem in cloud radio access network (C-RAN) architecture for 6G networks. By leveraging the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and utilizing IBM Qiskit as a simulation testbed, we aim to optimize task scheduling for enhancing wireless network performance. Herein, the classical quadratic constrained integer optimization (QCIO) problem instance is transformed to an Ising Hamiltonian formulation to implement task scheduling optimization on a quantum computer. We also evaluate the effectiveness and stability of QAOA by analyzing the expected cost and the probability of obtaining an optimal schedule as a function of QAOA circuit layers. Our findings highlight the applicability of variational quantum computing in addressing intricate optimization problems as well as setting the stage for the development of more advanced quantum optimization algorithms for 6G networks. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2024.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing resources are now becoming easily accessible from various cloud providers. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Security has always been a critical issue in machine learning (ML) applications. Due to the high cost of model training - such as collecting relevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power - model-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important issues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning (QML) model-stealing attack also exists and is even more severe because the traditional encryption method, such as homomorphic encryption can hardly be directly applied to quantum computation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources, the monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones in the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a third-party company can be delegated to a quantum cloud provider as a service to be used by ordinary users. In this case, the QML model is likely to be leaked if the cloud provider is under attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely QuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms, we propose to divide the complete QML model into multiple parts and distribute them to multiple physically isolated quantum cloud providers for execution. As such, even if the adversary in a single provider can obtain a partial model, it does not have sufficient information to retrieve the complete model. Although promising, we observed that an arbitrary model design under distributed settings cannot provide model security. We further developed a reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically optimize the model design under the distributed setting, such that a good trade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental results on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can achieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search under centralized settings while providing the highest security than the baselines. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing resources are predominantly accessible through cloud services, with a potential future shift to edge networks. This paradigm and the increasing global interest in quantum computing have amplified the need for efficient, adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum systems. However, many limitations in the quantum resources' quantity, quality, availability, and cost pose significant challenges for conducting research in practical environments. To address these challenges, we proposed iQuantum, a holistic and lightweight discrete-event simulation toolkit uniquely tailored to model hybrid quantum computing environments. We also present a detailed system model for prototyping and problem formulation in quantum resource management. Through rigorous empirical validation and evaluations using large-scale quantum workload datasets, we demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of our toolkit in various use cases. iQuantum provides a versatile environment for designing and evaluating quantum resource management policies such as quantum task scheduling, backend selection, hybrid task offloading, and orchestration in the quantum cloud-edge continuum. Our work endeavors to create substantial contributions to quantum computing modeling and simulation, empowering the creation of future resource management strategies and quantum computing's broader applications. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging area that yearly improves and develops more advances in the number of qubits and the available infrastructure for public users. Nowadays, the main cloud service providers (CSP) are implementing different mechanisms to support access to their quantum computers, which can be used to perform small experiments, test hybrid algorithms and prove quantum theories. Recent research work have discussed the low capacity of using quantum computers in a single CSP to perform quantum computation that are needed to solve different experiments for real world problems. Thus, there are needs for computing powers in the form of qubits from multi-cloud environment. Quantum computing in a multi-cloud environment requires security of the communicating channels. A well known algorithm in quantum cryptography for this purpose is the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. To address the low capacity issue, this research develops and tests the use of heterogeneous quantum computers located on different CSP to distribute quantum calculations between them by leveraging the channel security provided by the QKD protocol. The achieved results show over 88.1% of correct distributed quantum computation results without error correction methods, 96.8% of correct distributed quantum computation results using error correction methods and over 98.8% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments. This demonstrates that quantum calculations can be distributed between different CSP while securing the channel with the QKD protocol at the same time. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Security and privacy are issues that cannot be ignored when collecting and processing medical data in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that has diverse application scenarios in the medical field. The blockchain technology relies on traditional cryptography to ensure data integrity and verifiability, but the creation of quantum computing has made it possible to break traditional encryption and signature methods. Therefore, quantum blockchain can provide a higher level of security for handling medical data. This article innovatively designs a new medical data processing system based on quantum blockchain (QB-IMD). In QB-IMD, a quantum blockchain structure and a novel electronic medical record algorithm (QEMR) are proposed to ensure that the processed data is legitimate and tamper-proof. QEMR combines quantum signature and quantum identity authentication to avoid the potential security risks of digital signatures. In addition, through delegated computing by quantum cloud, medical diagnostic data can be computed without leaking to quantum cloud servers, thus protecting user privacy. Through mathematical proof, theoretical analysis, and simulation, it is demonstrated that our scheme can resist six attacks and is feasible to protect user privacy.  © 2014 IEEE.},

A common property of quantum computers is that they can exhibit instances of true randomness as opposed to pseudo-randomness obtained from classical systems. Investigating the effects of such true quantum randomness in the context of machine learning is appealing, and recent results vaguely suggest that benefits can indeed be achieved from the use of quantum random numbers. To shed some more light on this topic, we empirically study the effects of hardware-biased quantum random numbers on the initialization of artificial neural network weights in numerical experiments. We find no statistically significant difference in comparison with unbiased quantum random numbers as well as biased and unbiased random numbers from a classical pseudo-random number generator. The quantum random numbers for our experiments are obtained from real quantum hardware. © The Author(s) 2024.},

In response to these challenges, this research develops a comprehensive cyber-security trust model that provides multi-risk protection for secure data transmission in cloud computing, ensuring the highest level of privacy and data security. This innovative approach aims to ensure the secure transmission of data in cloud computing while harnessing the combined strengths of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Advanced Encryption Algorithm. As cloud environments become integral to modern business operations, safeguarding data against a multitude of security risks, including traditional and emerging threats, is paramount. The Cyber-Security Trust Model leverages blockchain to establish a transparent and tamper-resistant ledger of all data transactions within the cloud. This blockchain layer enhances data integrity, auditability, and traceability while also providing a decentralized and trust-based framework for authentication and authorization. The Multi-Risk Protection Model incorporates both Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and a Modified Advanced Encryption Standard (MAES) to offer multi-layered defence mechanisms. Through rigorous testing and analysis, this study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed Cyber-Security Trust Model with a Merkle tree-based solution for data integrity verification. It makes a significant impact on the field of secure data transmission in cloud computing by providing strong protection against a constantly changing set of security threats. MATLAB is employed to conduct rigorous experiments, analyse results, and validate the model’s performance in various cloud computing scenarios. The findings of the proposed study show the proposed method, combining Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) and Modified AES (MAES), stands out with exceptional performance, featuring encryption and decryption times of 2.25ms and 1.071ms, respectively. The proposed system outperforms all others, boasting an impressive accuracy rate of 99.84%.

	abstract = {Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is rapidly reaching a point in which its application design and engineering aspects must be seriously considered. However, quantum software engineering is still in its infancy, with numerous challenges, especially in dealing with the diversity of quantum programming languages and noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. To alleviate these challenges, we propose QFaaS, a holistic Quantum Function-as-a-Service framework, which leverages the advantages of the serverless model, DevOps lifecycle, and the state-of-the-art software techniques to advance practical quantum computing for next-generation application development in the NISQ era. Our framework provides essential elements of a serverless quantum system to streamline service-oriented quantum application development in cloud environments, such as combining hybrid quantum–classical computation, automating the backend selection, cold start mitigation, and adapting DevOps techniques. QFaaS offers a full-stack and unified quantum serverless platform by integrating multiple well-known quantum software development kits (Qiskit, Q#, Cirq, and Braket), quantum simulators, and cloud providers (IBM Quantum and Amazon Braket). This paper proposes the concept of quantum function-as-a-service, system design, operation workflows, implementation of QFaaS, and lessons learned on the benefits and limitations of quantum serverless computing.

	abstract = {With the popularity of cloud computing, a large number of personal and corporate data are outsourced to the cloud. This centralized storage and processing mode not only improves the efficiency of data processing, but also brings challenges to data security and privacy. In view of the development of quantum computing, the traditional public key encryption may no longer be secure in the future. Therefore, it is particularly important to study the public key authenticated keyword searchable encryption (PEAKS) scheme which can resist quantum. This scheme can provide double guarantee for the data in cloud storage: one is to ensure the confidentiality of the data, so that the original content cannot be decrypted even within the cloud service provider; the other is to allow users to perform keyword searches on encrypted data without decrypting the data. This provides a balance of security and efficiency for data search and analysis in cloud computing environment. Recently, Genise et al. designed a Gadget-based iNTRU trapdoor, which has the advantages of small size and high efficiency. Therefore, we design an efficient and secure public key authentication keyword searchable encryption scheme based on iNTRU lattice. The overall running time of this scheme is only more than 300ms. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {By implementing a high-frequency intelligent network of sensors, this work explores continuous monitoring and alerting for dynamic changes in water quality. Life depends on water, yet pollution is a greater menace. For this reason, precautions and careful observation are necessary. Typically, the focus on conventional water quality system monitoring is too much on data collection and needs more on analysis and extraction, limiting its capacity to offer thorough solutions. Making informed decisions becomes more complicated when there are discrepancies like damaged data, loss from power outages, or transmission issues. The proposed High-Frequency Intelligent Sensing Network (HFISN) monitoring system uses cloud computing, IoT and Big data technologies for intelligent sensing. Researchers developed it to address various challenges. Researchers recommend Nephelometric Turbidity Unit (NTU) Sensor installation to enhance the system’s performance and facilitate better monitoring of sedimentation, particle issues, and water purity. This sensor makes it possible to make more informed decisions by expanding the platform’s dataset. The solution not only resolves data cleaning and analysis issues but also includes intelligent early-warning capabilities for timely alerts. Quantum Cloud (QC) technology is employed to enhance security and accessibility. Test findings confirm its robustness with extra features and a built-in turbidity sensor. Because the platform ensures data accuracy and dependability, it provides decision-makers with a solid foundation to protect water resources. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the sub circuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for Preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the advancement of technology and time, people have always sought to solve problems in the most efficient and quickest way possible. Since the introduction of the cloud computing environment along with many different sub-substructures such as task schedulers, resource allocators, resource monitors, and others, various algorithms have been proposed to improve the performance of the individual unit or structure used in the cloud environment. The cloud is a vast virtual environment with the capability to solve any task provided by the user. Therefore, new algorithms are introduced with the aim to improve the process and consume less time to evaluate the process. One of the most important sections of cloud computing is that of the task scheduler, which is responsible for scheduling tasks to each of the virtual machines in such a way that the time taken to execute the process is less and the efficiency of the execution is high. Thus, this paper plans to propose an ideal and optimal task scheduling algorithm that is tested and compared with other existing algorithms in terms of efficiency, makespan, and cost parameters, that is, this paper tries to explain and solves the scheduling problem using an improved meta-heuristic algorithm called the Hybrid Weighted Ant Colony Optimization (HWACO) algorithm, which is an advanced form of the already present Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm. The outcomes found by using the proposed HWACO has more benefits, that is, the objective for reaching the convergence in a short period of time was accomplished; thus, the projected model outdid the other orthodox algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Quantum-Based Avian Navigation Optimizer Algorithm (QANA), Modified-Transfer-Function-Based Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (MTF-BPSO), MIN-MIN Algorithm (MM), and First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), making the proposed algorithm an optimal task scheduling algorithm. © 2023 by the authors.},

In a containerized cloud, traditional resource management strategies are typically used to allocate and migrate virtual machines. A major problem for cloud service providers is resource allocation for containers, which directly affects system performance and resource consumption. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization of load balancing and resource allocation in the cloud using an optimal container management strategy. We aim to enhance scheduling efficiency and reduce costs by improving the container's schedule requested digitally by users. An improved backtracking search optimization (IBSO) algorithm is used to allocate resources between end-users/IoT devices and the cloud under the consideration of service-level agreements. Mechanic quantum recurrent neural networks (MQ-RNNs) are designed to allocate, consolidate, and migrate containers in cloud environments. The various simulation measures used to validate the proposed strategy are energy consumption, number of active servers, number of interruptions, total cost, runtime, and statistical measures. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

However, even after 25+ years, researchers still struggle with stable error correction solutions for delivering a stable commercialised quantum universal quantum machine.

Therefore, researchers believe that QC would be introduced as an extension of classical computers (CC), where CC would offload a specific computational intensive task. Cloud companies, including Amazon, Azure, and IBM, have already begun to provide cloud services where an organisation can use a QC to work on potential applications.

	abstract = {Quantum computing has entered its mature life thanks to the availability of cloud-based Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies. These devices allow quantum researchers and practitioners to design, develop and test quantum algorithms on actual hardware, paving the way toward new approaches in solving problems intractable by classical computers. However, in spite of these achievements in quantum technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ devices. As a consequence, there is a strong need of introducing innovative computing architectures able to interconnect a set of NISQ devices to increase the capabilities of current quantum computers of solving hard problems in a reliable way. In this paper, the concept of Distributed Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (D-NISQ) is introduced as a reference computational model by which designing innovative frameworks where quantum devices interact to solve a complex problem by working cooperatively. In detail, the D-NISQ model consists of a hybrid and hierarchical architecture where classical and quantum processors interact to iteratively split up a problem into a collection of sub-problems, solve each one of them by means of a proper quantum algorithm, and fuse output quantum information so as to compute the final solution to the problem posed. As demonstrated by two case studies based on the well-known Grover's algorithm, a multi-threaded implementation of the D-NISQ reference model allows for greater reliability in solving problems by quantum computation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {We introduce a secure hardware device named a QEnclave that can secure the remote execution of quantum operations while only using classical controls. This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Since the convenience and advancement of cloud applications, many users (e.g., companies or individuals) adopt remote cloud services to reduce the local storage overload and computing consumption. However, before transferring them to the cloud server, users always encrypt outsourced data for the privacy of important data, which deprives flexible usage of these data. Public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) undoubtedly offers a precise resolution to this issue. Unfortunately, most PEKS schemes cannot fight against quantum computing attackers, which is increasingly a research hotspot. To achieve postquantum security and privacy-preserving search function, we propose a quantum-resistant PEKS scheme named IsoqurPEKS. Our proposed instantiation satisfies basic semantic security indistinguishable against chosen keyword attack (IND-CKA), and IsoqurPEKS is proved to be secure under the security model. Furthermore, we compare IsoqurPEKS with the other eight current PEKS schemes with respect to security properties, communication, and computation costs. The comparison results indicate that the proposed scheme has the best security and performance among the nine PEKS schemes.  © 2022 Qing Fan et al.},

	abstract = {With the increasing adoption of cloud computing, the deployment and management of business processes over cloud environments have become an essential operation for most enterprises, leading to the emergence of BPaaS (Business Process as a Service) as a new cloud service model. This SaaS-like service, like its ancestors, should be strategically distributed and managed over multiple cloud zones, while taking into account several constraints and conditions (e.g., sensitivity of BPaaS fragments, insecure and untrusted cloud zones, lack of resources, and workload changes). However, current BPaaS approaches are static, which means that they are no longer suitable to manage such enterprise-oriented cloud service model and to deal with the uncertain and dynamic nature of cloud availability zones. To fill this gap, we adopt a predictive BPaaS management strategy by proposing a model that forecasts the next-short time overload of cloud zones. These latter, as hosting environments for the managed BPaaS, are categorized as overloaded or underloaded, which triggers the migration of BPaaS fragments to high-performance cloud zones. The proposed neural network prediction model (called QGA-NN) is enhanced with a quantum genetic algorithm to optimize the prediction of cloud zones' overload. QGA-NN is evaluated using a BPaaS placement algorithm, which we defined as a triggered management operation. Experimental results have proved the accuracy and effectiveness of our predictive approach, compared with state-of-the-art solutions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This raises concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the results obtained from quantum computers. The problem is highlighted by experimental observation that today's NISQ devices are inherently unstable. Remote quantum cloud servers typically do not provide users with an ability to calibrate the device themselves. Using inaccurate characterization data for error mitigation can have devastating impact on reproducibility. In this study, we investigate if one can infer the critical channel parameters dynamically from the noisy binary output of the executed quantum circuit and use it to improve program stability. An open question however is how well does this methodology scale. We discuss the efficacy and efficiency of our adaptive algorithm using canonical quantum circuits such as the uniform superposition circuit. Our metric of performance is the Hellinger distance between the post-stabilization observations and the reference (ideal) distribution.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Despite the promises of quantum computing, many obstacles still stand in the way of its practical use, most notably quantum noise. Therefore, this study aims to describe and analyze the effect of noise on quantum computations. Analysis of noise includes the application of the Central Limit Theorem and the empirical rule to calculate broad bounds for future expected error, in circuits consisting of NOT and Hadamard gates. Analysis also includes the development of an empty quantum circuit error distribution, centered around 1.38%, with a standard deviation of 0.395%, and examines error trends as circuits grow in size and complexity. Finally, a discussion of quantum error correction is presented in the context of both current technology and future possibilities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The quantum computing simulator provides an effective platform for the development and verification of quantum algorithms. However, the running time and memory overhead during calculation will increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Therefore, the difficulty of high-speed quantum computing on classical computers will gradually increase. At present, a single node has been unable to meet the resource requirements of the algorithm in the quantum computing process, and it is necessary to expand the memory resources in the multi-node computing cluster. Message passing interface has high performance inter-process communication capabilities, which can balance the data transmission between different hosts. Quantum computing tasks can be distributed on several servers to work together to solve the same problem. Therefore, this paper designs an advanced scheme of deploying quantum computing programs on cloud computing platform to support message exchanging between servers using message passing interface to accelerate quantum computing. © 2022 IEEE.},

Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7% (up to 36.7%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Asymmetric cryptography plays an essential role in many areas, including cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, most of them are based on the difficulty of factorizing large numbers or discrete logarithm problems, which are not secure to quantum computer attacks. SimpleMatrix is a new multivariate encryption scheme based on simple matrix multiplications, which can resist quantum computer attacks. Because of the low speed and demands of large finite fields, SimpleMatrix is limited in applications that use small finite fields. As a result, it is critical to improve the efficiency of SimpleMatrix to make its applications broader. In this paper, we speed up the encryption and decryption of SimpleMatrix by building efficient small finite field arithmetics based on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) technology. We propose a fast architecture for encryption and decryption of SimpleMatrix based on table look-up based composite field multiplications and inversions and fast Gauss–Jordan elimination for solving systems of linear equations in a composite field. We test and verify the hardware architecture of SimpleMatrix on an FPGA, and the experimental results confirm our estimates and comparisons show that our design is much faster than other implementations. Thus, the hardware architecture can be used in FPGA-based systems of cloud computing, IoT, etc., for accelerating encryption and decryption. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The system consists of various tasks namely termed cloudlets which need to be fed among various processing units for its execution. However, the algorithm that has been used to schedule tasks among various processing units should provide the optimum solution to a given problem. This research realizes the power of quantum computation specifically quantum annealing to provide the optimum solution to schedule the tasks among various processing units under the given constraints. Quantum Annealing is used for combinatorial optimization problems and as task scheduling is also one of such problems, it can be done in the quantum environment for optimal results. The Hybrid Solver provided by the D-Wave Quantum Computer has been used to solve the given problem.Leveraging the D-Wave Quantum Annealer, we analyze various scheduling scenarios and evaluate the performance in terms of makespan and throughput. Our findings reveal substantial improvements in scheduling efficiency compared to Partical Swarm Optimization scheduling. Specifically, we observed a notable reduction in makespan by up to 70% across diverse workload scenarios. Moreover, there was not much difference in throughput provided by both algorithms. The task scheduling among various processing units using quantum annealing has provided significant differences in makespan. Thus, using an annealing technique to schedule the tasks in cloud computing would significantly enhance in load balancing and efficient use of resources.  © 2023 IEEE.},

With the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum computing. However, the limited quantity, quality, and accessibility of quantum resources pose significant challenges to practical research in quantum software and systems. To address these challenges, we propose iQuantum, a first-of-its-kind simulation toolkit that can model quantum computing environments for prototyping and evaluating system design and scheduling algorithms.

The problem of task scheduling represents a challenge in this type of environment, with the aim of how to allocate the tasks to the different nodes of the Fog-Cloud infrastructure, in order to minimize makespan, cost, response time, and energy. In this paper, we propose SQGA - an algorithm to improve the workflow scheduling in Fog-Cloud environment.

	abstract = {This work contains the analysis of results received after running synthesized quantum circuits for training perceptron neural networks. The training is performed by creating a Grover's algorithm with a custom oracle function. The concept of synthesizing quantum circuits was showcased in the process of generating training circuits for three perceptron topologies, which were designed to test the accuracy of the synthesis process. The test circuits serve to prove that the proposed synthesis approach could be scaled to utilize more complex quantum computing systems and to solve more practical tasks. IBM's 100-qubit cloud quantum simulator was used as the debugging environment. Quantum circuits for described algorithms are generated by the "Naginata"quantum synthesizer, its source code is published and further documented on GitHub along with the code for the provided example algorithms. The article describes the processes behind the algorithm for synthesizing quantum circuits that perform the training process of single-layer perceptrons by finding their weights by filtering all possible input values through a predefined accuracy criterion. Since quantum computing is still in its early development phase, quantum circuits are created mainly by manual placement of logic elements. Implementing quantum algorithms, especially more use-case specific ones, directly on the quantum circuit level could lead to the circuit easily becoming too complex for human comprehension. Quantum Circuit Synthesizer "Naginata"was created to simplify the development and debugging process of quantum algorithms, by adding better clarity to their development process. In our case, better clarity for the development process is achieved by composing functions for commonly used operations performed in the implemented quantum algorithm. The programmer could now implement the quantum algorithm as a set of functions, instead of manually creating a circuit from single logic elements. After this, the synthesizer would handle the task of creating the data for placing logic elements on the circuit. This enables an opportunity of implementing quantum algorithms with higher-level commands. In the scope of this work, parametrically generated generic blocks for frequently used operations such as: the adder, multiplier and digital comparator were created and utilized to form the training circuits. The test results, proved that with the help of the proposed quantum synthesizer, these compositions could be used efficiently as building blocks for implementing quantum algorithms. And by visually comparing sizes of both code and circuit representations of the synthesized circuits, to the code examples used to synthesize these circuits, it is determined that the proposed approach for implementing quantum circuits greatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a quantum algorithm. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As cloud computing has developed rapidly, outsourcing data to cloud servers for remote storage has become an attractive trend. However, when cloud clients store their data in the cloud, the security and privacy of cloud data would be threatened due to accidental corruptions or purposive attacks caused by a semi-trusted cloud server. The widely used method of addressing the security and privacy of cloud data is to store encrypted data instead of plain data. As the resulting system is unusable, since the cloud can no longer search throughout the data, new cryptographic primitive such as public-key encryption with equality test (PKEET) has been introduced. PKEET has many interesting applications such as keyword search on encrypted data, encrypted data partitioning for efficient encrypted data management, personal health record systems, spam filtering in encrypted email systems and so forth. PKEET allows checking whether two ciphertexts encrypted under different public keys contain the same message or not. However, unrestricted access to equality tests can reveal information about the underlying data. This is not acceptable in respect of users' privacy. In 2015, Ma et al. introduce the notion of PKEET with flexible authorization (PKEET-FA) which strengthens privacy protection. Since 2015, there are several follow-up works on PKEET-FA. However, all are secure in the random oracle model and vulnerable to quantum attacks. In this paper, we provide two constructions of quantum-safe PKEET-FA secure in the standard model based on the hardness assumptions of integer lattices and ideal lattices. Finally, we implement the PKEET-FA scheme over ideal lattices. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a significant technology domain, primarily due to the emergence of big data, machine learning, and quantum computing applications. While earlier, cloud computing services were focused mainly on providing storage and some infrastructures/ platforms for applications, the need to advance compu-tational power analysis of massive datasets. It has made cloud computing almost inevitable from most client-based applications, mobile applications, or web applications. The allied challenge to protect data shared from and to cloud-based platforms has cropped up with the necessity to access public clouds. While conventional cryptographic algorithms have been used for securing and authenticat-ing cloud data, advancements in cryptanalysis and access to faster computation have led to possible threats to the traditional security of cloud mechanisms. This has led to extensive research in homomorphic encryption pertaining to cloud security. In this paper, a security mechanism is designed targeted towards dynamic groups using public clouds. Cloud security mechanisms generally face a significant challenge in terms of overhead, throughput, and execution time to encrypt data from dynamic groups with frequent member addition and removal. A two-stage homomorphic encryption process is proposed for data security in this paper. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated in terms of the salient cryptographic metrics, which are the avalanche effect, throughput, and execution time. A comparative analysis with conventional cryptographic algorithms shows that the proposed system outperforms them regarding the cryptographic performance metrics. © 2022, Industrial Research Institute for Automation and Measurements.

	abstract = {The popularity of cloud computing platforms has risen dramatically in recent years. As cloud computing serves millions of users at the same time, it must be able to handle all those users' demands efficiently. Thus, choosing a suitable scheduling algorithm is crucial in the cloud computing environment in order to ensure efficient performance with a reasonable degree of quality of service (QoS). The primary goal of this research is to empirically implement and evaluate a recently proposed Round-Robin algorithm with smart time quantum (RR-STQ) in a cloud computing environment, as well as, to enhance the RR-STQ with a dynamic smart time quantum. The CloudSim tool was used to simulate the cloud computing platform to implement RR-STQ and evaluate it with several algorithms using different scenarios. In addition, three scheduling performance metrics were used in the evaluation process. In all comparison scenarios, the (RR-STQ) achieved a significant improvement rate in terms of average response time (RT). Moreover, (RR-STQ) has a better performance in the average turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), and response time (RT) than the traditional RR algorithm. Also, the implemented algorithm (RR-STQ) with dynamic time quantum has a better performance than static time quantum. Based on the evaluation results, it is beneficial to integrate the RR algorithm with other scheduling models such as shortest job first (SJF) to enhance the WT and TAT. Furthermore, the investigations revealed that the dynamic time quantum improves the performance of the RR algorithm.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sensors, enabling observations across vast spatial, spectral, and temporal scales, are major data generators for information technology (IT). Processing, storing, and communicating this ever-growing amount of data pose challenges for the current IT infrastructure. Edge computing—an emerging paradigm to overcome the shortcomings of cloud-based computing—could address these challenges. Furthermore, emerging technologies such as quantum computing, quantum sensing, and quantum communications have the potential to fill the performance gaps left by their classical counterparts. Here, we present the concept of an edge quantum computing (EQC) simulator—a platform for designing the next generation of edge computing applications. An EQC simulator is envisioned to integrate elements from both quantum technologies and edge computing to allow studies of quantum edge applications. The presented concept is motivated by the increasing demand for more sensitive and precise sensors that can operate faster at lower power consumption, generating both larger and denser datasets. These demands may be fulfilled with edge quantum sensor networks. Envisioning the EQC era, we present our view on how such a scenario may be amenable to quantification and design. Given the cost and complexity of quantum systems, constructing physical prototypes to explore design and optimization spaces is not sustainable, necessitating EQC infrastructure and component simulators to aid in co-design. We discuss what such a simulator may entail and possible use cases that invoke quantum computing at the edge integrated with new sensor infrastructures. © 2022 by the authors.},

And, the data securities in the 6G Systems may face great challenges. On the one hand, fine-grained data access control in fog and cloud computing environments is essential to the 6G network. On the other hand, quantum computing attacks may cause great security threats for the 6G network. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a lattice-based fine-grained data access control and sharing scheme in fog and cloud computing environments (LB-DACSS) for the 6G network. Firstly, our LB-DACSS scheme can achieve secure data sharing and fine-grained access control in fog and cloud computing environments. Secondly, we apply a lattice encryption algorithm to ensure our LB-DACSS scheme can withstand quantum computing attacks. Thirdly, our LB-DACSS scheme can achieve secure attribute revocation. Fourthly, we bind a unique secret value related to the user's attribute to construct the user's secret key. Finally, both formal security analysis and performance analysis show that our LB-DACSS scheme is efficient and secure. © 2022 IEEE.},

As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-As-A-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-Trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ≈ 30%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ≈ .  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a rapidly progressing field: quantum computers are becoming more powerful and an increasing number of functionalities are offered via various quantum platforms and quantum software packages. Current quantum computers can be used almost exclusively via cloud services. It is expected that this will remain the case, at least in the near-term future. For successful adoption of quantum computing by the market, quantum cloud services should be user-centric. To that end, we explore quantum cloud computing from a user perspective. We describe a standardised overview of quantum cloud computing as a whole to create a common language to strengthen research and collaboration on quantum cloud computing. Specifically, we identify different types, information flows and relevant user functionalities of quantum cloud computing, based on their counterparts in classical cloud computing. Combined, this gives an overview of quantum cloud computing for the best user experience, paving the way towards user-centric quantum cloud computing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The DNS data generally have, a high spatial resolution ≈ 1mm and require considerable space to store. It is tedious to find specific features of this data, such as locating high and low vortex areas in cloud turbulence using machine learning algorithms. In this research, we employ quantum computing to examine and analyze cloud droplet dynamics data and present a quantum supervised machine learning algorithm, namely, a support vector machine (SVM) to segregate low and high vortex regions and investigate the droplet characteristics in those regions.

As we move from the initial standalone quantum algorithms toward complex solutions combining quantum algorithms with traditional software, new software engineering methods and abstractions are needed. Nowadays, quantum computers are usually offered in the cloud, under a pay-per-use model, leading to the adoption of the service-oriented good practices that dominate the cloud today. However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway-an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time. As proof of concept, we provide an implementation of the Quantum API Gateway for the Amazon Braket platform. © 1997-2012 IEEE.},

Often missed, yet equally important, is the discussion on how to actually run quantum software applications or models in a production environment where they run in an event-based or scheduled manner thereby providing the results to the enterprise which has spent time upskilling their development team and developing the quantum software solution.In this paper, we introduce a hybrid classical-quantum cloud architecture blueprint which starts from the code-level software development level, and extends to the production-ready quantum software application level. We then, for the first time, introduce a novel sample optimization application used in the energy industry for Peer-2-Peer energy trading and deploy it using the proposed cloud architecture blueprint. We demonstrate sample output of the live-running application where trading optimizations occurs on an hourly basis via remote connection to a quantum computing cloud backend.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program.

Recently, many researchers have proposed encryption schemes to achieve quantum attack resistance and fine-grained data access control. However, single point of failure and secure attribute revocation are two critical problems for quantum-resistant encryption scheme in cloud storage environments. In order to deal with these problems, in this paper, we propose a revocable multi-authority attribute-based encryption from lattice (RMA-ABE-L) in cloud storage. Firstly, RMA-ABE-L scheme can achieve fine-grained data access control with quantum computing attack resistance. We design efficient anti-quantum algorithms based on R-LWE problem, and merge them with ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) structure. Secondly, RMA-ABE-L scheme can solve the single point of failure problem. We design the multi-authority structure to so that the compromise of some authorities does not affect the functioning of the whole data sharing system. Moreover, RMA-ABE-L scheme can realize secure attribute revocation. We design a secure attribute revocation mechanism and set special identity construction. The performance analysis shows that RMA-ABE-L scheme is more efficient than other related schemes. © 2023 SPIE.},

Minimizing Waiting Time (WT), Minimizing Turnaround Time (TAT), Minimizing Response Time (RT) and Improves Resource Utilization are the important parameter for Task Scheduling. As an outcome various strategies have been suggested and implemented in order to improve scheduling performance. Because of its simplicity and fairness Round Robin (RR) is treated as the best scheduling algorithm. Our proposed algorithm named Enhanced Round Robin Algorithm for Cloud Scheduling (ERACS). The proposed algorithm reduces Average Waiting Time (AWT), Average Turnaround Time (ATAT), Average Response Time (ART) and Number of Context Switches (NCS).

Simultaneously, due to the need for fine-grained access control in cloud environments, it is crucial to do the research on attribute-based encryption (ABE). However, researches on ABE algorithm have some problems such as not having mechanisms secure enough to defend against quantum computing attacks with high decryption accuracy, having vulnerabilities to collusion attacks and lacking of attribute revocation mechanism. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a new data encryption scheme with fine-grained access control based on the shortest vector problem in the cloud computing environment (DES-SVP). We formally prove that our DES-SVP scheme can resist quantum computing attacks and can resist collusion attacks between users. We reduce our DES-SVP scheme to the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice so that our scheme can withstand quantum computing attacks. Finally, the performance analysis shows that our DES-SVP scheme can achieve efficient results comparing with other related works.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) strongly influences the world economy; this emphasizes the importance of securing all four aspects of the IoT model: sensors, networks, cloud, and applications. Considering the significant value of public-key cryptography threats on IoT system confidentiality, it is vital to secure it. One of the potential candidates to assist in securing public key cryptography in IoT is quantum computing. Although the notion of IoT and quantum computing convergence is not new, it has been referenced in various works of literature and covered by many scholars. Quantum computing eliminates most of the challenges in IoT. This research provides a comprehensive introduction to the Internet of Things and quantum computing before moving on to public-key cryptography difficulties that may be encountered across the convergence of quantum computing and IoT. An enhanced architecture is then proposed for resolving these public-key cryptography challenges using SimuloQron to implement the BB84 protocol for quantum key distribution (QKD) and one-time pad (OTP). The proposed model prevents eavesdroppers from performing destructive operations in the communication channel and cyber side by preserving its state and protecting the public key using quantum cryptography and the BB84 protocol. A modified version is introduced for this IoT situation. A traditional cryptographic mechanism called “one-time pad” (OTP) is employed in hybrid management. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Topics such as computational sources and cloud-based transmission and security of big data have turned out to be a major new domain of exploration due to the exponential evolution of cloud-based data and grid facilities. Various categories of cloud services have been utilized more and more widely across a variety of fields like military, army systems, medical databases, and more, in order to manage data storage and resource calculations. Attribute-based encipherment (ABE) is one of the more efficient algorithms that leads to better consignment and safety of information located within such cloud-based storage amenities. Many outmoded ABE practices are useful for smaller datasets to produce fixed-size cryptograms with restricted computational properties, in which their characteristics are measured as evidence and stagnant standards used to generate the key, encipherment, and decipherment means alike. To surmount the existing problems with such limited methods, in this work, a dynamic nonlinear poly randomized quantum hash system is applied to enhance the safety of cloud-based information. In the proposed work, users' attributes are guaranteed with the help of a dynamic nonlinear poly randomized equation to initialize the chaotic key, encipherment, and decipherment. In this standard, structured and unstructured big data from clinical datasets are utilized as inputs. Real-time simulated outcomes demonstrate that the stated standard has superior exactness, achieving over 90% accuracy with respect to bit change and over 95% accuracy with respect to dynamic key generation, encipherment time, and decipherment time compared to existing models from the field and literature. Experimental results are demonstrated that the proposed cloud security standard has a good efficiency in terms of key generation, encoding, and decoding process than the conventional methods in a cloud computing environment.  © 2022 Kranthi Kumar Singamaneni et al.},

	abstract = {In recent years, cloud computing plays a vital role in IT industries. Cloud computing is the sum of software as a service (SaaS) and utility computing (hardware). Elliptic Curve Cryptography provides more efficient performance and security for a cloud environment. The usage of Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) has escrow and revocation problems. These problems make a burden on the cloud and create access failure to the cloud users. Therefore, we use a novel signcryption technique Zheng (1997) to recover the escrow and revocation problems from the cloud/edge. We proposed “A Qu antum Sig ncryption S cheme (QuSigS) to Recover Key Escrow Problem (KEP) (Niu et al. 2009, Zhang et al. 2015, Chen and Ma 2014) and Key Revocation Problem (KRP) (Al-Dahhan et al. Sens Multidiscipl Digit Publish Inst 19(7):1–22 2019, Li et al. IEEE Access 8:176738–176749 2020) in cloud computing”. Our proposed QuSigS scheme reduced communication and computational overheads, memory storage, and execution time, at the user side and at the server side. Our applied techniques for the user side is signcryption and for the server side is unsigncryption. The efficient result calculation from (3) in percentage for the user side and server side is 16.66% for 112 bits, 13.04% for 160 bits, 16.66% for 256 bits on the user side and the server side it is 9.52% respectively. The efficiency of our scheme is 4.17% for signcryption and 9.52% for unsigncryption as compared to existing schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

However, current quantum computers still suffer from a small number of qubits and high error rates. Selecting a quantum computer providing enough qubits and low error rates is tremendously important to receive stable execution results for a given quantum circuit. The execution results are also influenced by the compilation result of the selected quantum compiler for hardware mapping and optimization. For computing time, the access is regulated by vendors of quantum computers resulting in waiting times for the user. Thus, a deep and manifold analysis of quantum computers and compiled circuits of different quantum compilers is required to estimate in advance which compiled circuit will return stable execution results also in consideration of non-functional requirements such as waiting times. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes and prioritizes compiled circuits for different quantum computers using several compilers based on the requirements of the user.

TI systems with multiple interconnected traps can overcome the hardware connectivity issue inherent in superconducting qubits and can solve practical problems at scale. With a sufficient number of qubits on the horizon, the multi-programming model for Quantum Computers (QC) has been proposed where multiple users share the same QC for their computing. Multi-programming is enticing for quantum cloud providers as it can maximize device utilization, throughput, and profit for clouds. Users can also benefit from the short wait queue. However, shared access to quantum computers can create new security issues. This paper presents one such vulnerability in shared TI systems that require shuttle operations for communication among traps. Repeated shuttle operations increase quantum bit energy and degrade the reliability of computations (fidelity). We show adversarial program design approaches requiring numerous shuttles. We propose a random and systematic methodology for adversary program generation. Our analysis shows shuttle-exploiting attacks can substantially degrade the fidelities of victim programs by ≈ 2 × to ≈ 63 ×. Finally, we present several countermeasures such as adopting a hybrid initial mapping policy, padding victim programs with dummy qubits, and capping maximum shuttles.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing shows immense potential for solving traditional, near to impossible, complex problems. It also shows how the performance and speed can be improved for the solution of existing classical problems by using quantum mechanics. However, the computation power of current computers, servers, and supercomputers is well enough to speed up the existing problem solutions. But as data generated from various resources increases rapidly, in current scenarios more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is generated daily and is expected to be 200+ zettabytes on the cloud by 2025. Handling and storing such a massive amount of data is a significant issue for current computing and storage devices. Quantum computing has the capability to resolve this issue with quantum rules. In this paper, the task of pattern finding and recognizing in data (i.e., machine learning) is explored with the help of quantum computing and introducing a collaborative learning architecture. It enables collaborative computation from heterogeneous quantum computing devices for machine learning tasks. Also, it can be adapted to any quantum machine learning approach and speed up the learning phase with better data privacy. The proposed scheme is implemented with the MNIST dataset to compare with current existing research work. Results show that the proposed architecture matches existing research work’s performance with the additional features of privacy and heterogeneity of quantum devices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Each day more and more data is produced by different sources including humans and machines, and they are stored mainly in Cloud Service Providers (CSP) in huge data storages known as big data or data lakes. Many situations warrant users to spread their data in a distributed way between the different CSP. When this happens, they have to relay the inter-cloud communication security to each cloud vendor. This can cause data leakage in the transmission channel thereby compromise information security. Quantum computing has shown some promises to address this issue. One well known algorithm in quantum cryptography is the Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. There are studies integrating this QKD protocol with cloud storage and data transmission inside one CSP. However, there is no research that studies the data lake security concern for distributed multi-cloud communications taking advantage of quantum mechanisms. This research proposal aims to address this gap in distributed data lake security by using the QKD protocol in the multi-cloud distributed data transmission. The achieved results show over 91% detection of eavesdropping cases and over 99% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments.

	abstract = {Smart Cities are becoming a reality now with ample interest and investment from both government and private entities. As the number of Smart Cities increases, so does the sheer size and variety of data, the major part of which comes from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors embedded in devices. Millions of intelligent devices may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or threats, potentially harming one or more connected devices or exposing sensitive data. Therefore, Smart Cities have Intelligent Operations Centers (IOC), using different machine learning (ML) algorithms to monitor the data and take necessary actions to protect or contain any security incident. The advent of Quantum Computing (QC) has led to many initiatives for using QC in various applications of a Smart City but using Quantum Computing as a service is not yet fully contemplated in this context. In this work, we propose an architecture for Smart City security using Quantum as a Service (QaaS) for analyzing and classifying Smart City data. The proposed architecture uses two different Quantum Classifiers, implemented in the D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud (QBoost) and IBM Quantum Services (Variational Quantum Classifier), for real-time classification of data and displays security incidents on a conveniently designed dashboard for further actions by the Security Operations Center (SOC) specialist. Further experiments have shown that D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud-based QBoost performed the best among the quantum classifiers both regarding quality and time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Concerns about cloud technology stem primarily from users' concerns regarding data security and privacy. The heterogeneity of cloud resources and the numerous shared applications they serve can benefit from effective scheduling. Goal of this study is to improve cloud soft computing's resource allocation and data protection using a secure channel model and machine learning architecture combined with distributed social networks. The cloud architecture data protection in the proposed network model is accomplished by developing the channel model using hierarchical lightweight cryptography analysis. Then, Q-bayes propagation quantum networks are used to allocate resources. Memory capacity, data protection analysis, throughput, end–end delay, and processing time are all used in experimental analysis.

The use of quantum computing allows accelerating the solution of several economic problems, logistics, virology, and many high technologies, which determines the financing of this area's basic research around the world. The goal of the article is to study algorithms for solving routing problems on quantum computers. It should be noted that modern quantum computers have significant limitations on both the number of qubits and the number of connections between qubits or the limited depth of the circuit. In addition, modern quantum computers can give only approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, which is a consequence of the imperfection of technologies for creating and maintaining the stability of quantum states and many other physical limitations. This means that many routing algorithms will not soon be able to run on quantum computers. Therefore, the authors limited the review of quantum algorithms for solving the problem of vehicle routing to a list of algorithms that have been tested on real quantum computers and for which the source code for programs is given by their developers. Algorithms and computational schemes for solving the problem of vehicle routing on modern hybrid quantum-classical cloud services of IBM and D-wave, as well as quantum computer simulators, are studied and discussed. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.  © 2022 ACM.},

Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) has emerged as an efficient means of searching encrypted data stored in the cloud. However, existing ABKS schemes incur high end-to-end delay and are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks and/or (insider) keyword guessing attacks (KGA). To address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a new concept called attribute-based authenticated encryption with keyword search (ABAEKS) and proposes an efficient ABAEKS scheme. Our ABAEKS has low end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and (insider) KGA. In addition, we formalize the security model of ABAEKS system and prove its security in the random oracle model. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of ABAEKS, and the experimental results show that our ABAEKS is computationally efficient and outperforms current state-of-the-art ABKS schemes.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {On-demand resource availability and pay-as-you-go are the key benefits of cloud computing. It eases the cloud service users to adjust the computing demands and pay accordingly. However, cloud service providers offer different provisioning plans for virtual machines (VMs): reservation-based plans and on-demand access plans. The key premise of reserved VMs is the upfront fee paid by the users; i.e., the higher the upfront payments by users, the more significant the discounts. However, these benefits can only be availed by instance usage. In contrast, on-demand VMs can be leased with comparatively higher time quanta fees. Under such a scenario, leasing cloud VMs from an infrastructure service provider would be problematic. The variations in the arriving workloads can render either under-provisioning or over-provisioning for the Software as a Service (SaaS) provider. Under-provisioning would cause Service-Level Agreements (SLA) violations. In contrast, over-provisioning would inflict higher leasing costs at the SaaS provider. So, this paper chronologically investigates all such issues under high varying workloads as well as low varying workloads. Unlike other studies, this paper investigates VMs leasing plan for mobile device users by considering waiting time as a quality of service (QoS) metric. Simulation results show that purchasing a mixed blend of reserved and on-demand VMs yields better monetary cost-savings even in low varying workloads. We also outline the open challenges for the mixed resource leasing plans. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

These are considered to be complex problems that today's supercomputers are still facing. On the other hand, Quantum computing promises fast, efficient, and scalable computing resources that are sufficient to compute large and complex operations in exponential time. It is a fact that Quantum computing will adequately innovate the computation perspective. However, it is not a feasible solution yet as it is likely to be rare and highly expensive to produce. This paper presents a Quantum Cloud-as-a-service for an efficient, scalable, and secure solution for complex Smart Healthcare computations.

To achieve higher permanence computing, we provide combined CPU, GPU, and QPU architecture in this work. This paper provides a roadmap for truly high-performance computing for massive real-time systems. In addition, we present an onsite and cloud-based architecture for scalability.

These HQC algorithms help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources.  © 2023 IEEE.},

For small to huge computing tasks, providing any software, platform, or infrastructure as a service, pay-n-use technique should be possible in distributed computing. Based on the duration and amount of administration utilization, the payment will be determined. The principle aim of the distributed computing is to create a resource where anybody can get to any help, whatsoever from anyplace. Protection and security are the fundamental dangers and issues of distributed computing. To overcome such problems in distributed computing, multi-tenure and framework sub-contracting method is used. The proposed encoding technique is far speedier and more effective than traditional encryption, for example, DNA-based encryption computing. To protect the information from intruders, better safety efforts are required. This theoretical investigation recommends such a strategy to defend against certain attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a new paradigm for solving problems that classical computers cannot reach. To the point that it is already generating interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently, quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have already built functional quantum computers, and developed several programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Attribute-based encryption is a public key encryption algorithm that allows cloud users to secure their sensitive information in the public cloud servers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is required to improve the security of communication systems. Quantum cryptographic scheme completely depends on quantum mechanics. The major objective of quantum key distribution is to generate a key that takes part in encryption. Traditional attribute-based encryption models are insecure and possible of key distribution attacks using man-in-the-middle attacks. Also, as the size of the input data increases, traditional ABE models failed to compute efficient secret key due to computational time and network overhead. To overcome these issues, a novel chaotic integrity and quantum key distribution (QKD)-based cipher text policy ABE model is implemented in cloud environment. Experimental results proved that the proposed model has high computation speed, storage overhead and secured key distribution compared to traditional CP-ABE, KPABE and QKD-ABE models.

This assumption is at the basis of our study. The tools are 1) identifying new parameters for the production of fixed structures identified in the Planat model mathematical theories; 2) using Charles Baudelaire’s narrative text [3] to clarify the importance of the verb in the sentence through the research and experimentation method into a local grammar; 3) utilizing Max Silberztein's NooJ system [4], for the production of sentence analysis and paraphrases, tools for developing formal dictionaries and grammars, and NLP applications such as semantic annotators; 4) developing the implementation of advanced integrated Machine Learning algorithms for the creation of knowledge from obtained data; 5) applying the BuViTeMS (© 2020) AW Digital Intelligence model for the production of edited, reformulated and translated sentences using a mixed system.

Using only cloud access to quantum computers, we complete thorough performance analysis of what some current quantum computing systems are capable of for practical applications involving nontrivial mid-to-high-dimensional datasets. We first benchmark how well distance estimation can be performed using two different metrics based on the swap-test, using angle and amplitude data embedding. Next, for the clustering performance analysis, we generate sets of synthetic data with varying cluster variance and compare simulation to physical hardware results using the two metrics. From the results of this performance analysis, we propose a general, competitive, and parallelized version of quantum $k$-means clustering to avoid some pitfalls discovered due to noisy hardware and apply the approach to a real energy grid clustering scenario. Using real-world German electricity grid data, we show that the new approach improves the balanced accuracy of the standard quantum $k$-means clustering by 67.8% with respect to the labeling of the classical algorithm.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has ceased to be an exotic topic for researchers, moving its treatment today from theoretical physicists to computer scientists and engineers. Recently, several real quantum devices have become available through the cloud. On the other hand, different possibilities on-premises allow having quantum computing simulators using High-Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities. Nevertheless, they did not expect to be very limited, in the near term, the number and quality of the fundamental storage element, the qubit. Therefore, software quantum simulators are the only widely available tools to design and test quantum algorithms. However, the representation of quantum computing components in classical computers consumes significant resources. In quantum computing, a state composed of n qubits will be a union of all possible combinations of n 0s and 1s. That is to say, the size of the information is. The amplitude is the magnitude associated with every variety and is composed of a complex number. This paper shows a survey of different implementations to simulate quantum computing supported by classical computing, highlighting important considerations for implementing and developing solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In recent years, quantum computing (QC) has been getting a lot of attention from industry and academia. Especially, among various QC research topics, variational quantum circuit (VQC) enables quantum deep reinforcement learning (QRL). Many studies of QRL have shown that the QRL is superior to the classical reinforcement learning (RL) methods under the constraints of the number of training parameters. This paper extends and demonstrates the QRL to quantum multi-agent RL (QMARL). However, the extension of QRL to QMARL is not straightforward due to the challenge of the noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) and the non-stationary properties in classical multi-agent RL (MARL). Therefore, this paper proposes the centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) QMARL framework by designing novel VQCs for the framework to cope with these issues. To corroborate the QMARL framework, this paper conducts the QMARL demonstration in a single-hop environment where edge agents offload packets to clouds. The extensive demonstration shows that the proposed QMARL framework enhances 57.7% of total reward than classical frameworks.  © 2022 IEEE.},

There has been no transition from the laboratory use of quantum computers to more widespread use of the technology. As a result, quantum simulation has emerged as the accepted norm for supporting the validation of quantum algorithms. Many conventional algorithms benefit from grover's quantum search method because it accelerates their usage of search heuristics. For better multi-core load balancing, memory utilization, and simulation efficiency, this research presented a high-performance grover method simulation that combines the benefits of grover's technique with the parallel of cloud computing. This study also suggests and experimentally compares five distinct cloud-based computing architectures that are well-suited to quantum simulation. Through research and testing, this study also verifies the optimization's efficiency. Depending on the size of the current configuration, the experimental results reveal that the simulation can reach 31 bits. © 2023 IEEE.},

Enterprises such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft have launched or will launch shortly cloud quantum computing services, which will accelerate forward the development of the field even further. It is, therefore, necessary to prepare the RAMS community to harness the advantages that quantum computing may offer to our discipline. In this paper, we present a proposed application for efficient probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks using gate-based quantum computing and a quantum algorithm called Amplitude Amplification. The proposed methodology is exemplified on a non-Trivial Bayesian network, composed of nodes representing discrete probability distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use Bayesian networks in combination with Amplitude Amplification for the risk and reliability assessment context. The results indicate that the usage of quantum computing can effectively increase the efficiency of the sampling process, decreasing the number of samples required to obtain estimates of similar quality when compared to a traditional Monte Carlo sampling approach. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, quantum computing has undergone significant developments and has established its supremacy in many application domains. While quantum hardware is accessible to the public through the cloud environment, a robust and efficient quantum circuit simulator is necessary to investigate the constraints and foster quantum computing development, such as quantum algorithm development and quantum device architecture exploration. In this paper, we observe that most of the publicly available quantum circuit simulators (e.g., QISKit from IBM, QDK from Microsoft, and Qsim-Cirq from Google) suffer from slow simulation and poor scalability when the number of qubits increases. To this end, we systematically investigate the deficiencies in quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and propose Q-GPU, a framework that leverages GPUs with comprehensive optimizations to allow efficient and scalable QCS. Specifically, Q-GPU features i) proactive state amplitude transfer, ii) zero state amplitude pruning, iii) delayed qubit involvement, and iv) lossless nonzero state amplitude compression. Experimental results across nine representative quantum circuits indicate that Q-GPU significantly reduces the execution time of the state-of-the-art GPU-based QCS by 71.89% (3.55× speedup). Q-GPU also outperforms the state-of-the-art OpenMP CPU implementation, the Google Qsim-Cirq simulator, and the Microsoft QDK simulator by 1.49×, 2.02×, and 10.82×, respectively.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Many traditional authentication protocols are proposed to secure public cloud computing. However, the rapid development of high-speed internet and organizations’ race to develop quantum computers is a nightmare for existing authentication schemes. These traditional authentication protocols are based on factorization or discrete logarithm problems. As a result, traditional authentication protocols are vulnerable in the quantum computing era. Therefore, in this article, we have proposed an authentication protocol based on the lattice technique for public cloud computing to resist quantum attacks and prevent all known traditional security attacks. The proposed lattice-based authentication protocol is provably secure under the Real-Or-Random (ROR) model. At the same time, the result obtained during the experiments proved that our protocol is lightweight compared to the existing lattice-based authentication protocols, as listed in the performance analysis section. The comparative analysis shows that the protocol is suitable for practical implementation in a quantum-based environment. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

The IoT devices generate unprecedented amounts of data, and IoT services mandate faster processing of those generated data. Current explorations use cloud computing as a foundation to process latency-sensitive IoT applications. Nevertheless, cloud environment has limitations in terms of geographical centralized architecture, multi-hop distance from the data source which adversely affects the latency sensitivity of the IoT services. To combat this issue, the fog computing has emerged as a promising paradigm that provides cloud-like elastic services to the close proximity of end devices. Hence, fog-assisted cloud computing environments can be used to execute the time-critical IoT applications. However, the fog environment includes the large number of fog devices which are typically resource-constrained, heterogeneous, distributed, dynamic, and less energy-efficient than the centralized cloud. Hence, the efficient secure resource management in fog is still a challenging issue. Quantum computing techniques can be envisioned as an effective means of providing secure and efficient resource management solutions in fog environments. Therefore, this paper discusses the concerns and challenges associated with the quantum computing-based fog resource management approaches and highlights the promising future research directions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing (QC) has been a focus of research for many researchers over the last few years. As a result of technological development, QC resources are also becoming available and usable to solve practical problems in the Information Retrieval (IR) and Recommender Systems (RS) fields. Nowadays IR and RS need to perform complex operations on very large datasets. In this scenario, it could be possible to increase the performance of these systems both in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by employing QC and, especially, Quantum Annealing (QA). The goal of this work is to design a Lab composed of different Shared Tasks that aims to: compare the performance of QA approaches with respect to their counterparts using traditional hardware;identify new ways of formulating problems so that they can be solved with quantum annealers;allow researchers from to different fields (e.g., Information Retrieval, Operations Research..) to work together and learn more about QA technologies. This Lab uses the QC resources provided by CINECA, one of the most important computing centers worldwide, thanks to an already met agreement. In addition, we also show a possible implementation of the required infrastructure which uses Docker containers and the Kubernetes orchestrator to ensure scalability, fault tolerance and that can be deployed on the cloud. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Recent advancements in cloud-based quantum computing infrastructure and developments in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have ushered in a new era of quantum-enhanced algorithms that can be utilized to enhance the accuracy of real-time incident detection. In this study, a combination of classical and quantum machine learning (ML) models is developed to identify incidents using connected vehicle (CV) data. The performance of the hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model in incident detection is compared to baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data from a microsimulation tool that simulates different incident scenarios. Results show that a hybrid neural network with a 4-qubit quantum layer outperforms all other baseline models considered in this study, even when training data is scarce. Three datasets made are DS-1 with enough training data, DS-2, and DS-3 without enough training data. The hybrid approach produces recall rates of 98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and DS-3, the hybrid model outperforms the classical models on average by 1.9% and 7.8%, respectively, for F2-score, a metric for the model's ability to correctly recognize occurrences. These results indicate that in realistic scenarios with limited connected vehicles at certain times on specific roadways, the hybrid ML model performs better than classical models. As quantum computing infrastructure continues to improve, quantum ML models could offer a promising alternative for ML applications related to connected vehicles, especially when the available data is insufficient.  © 2023 International Society of Information Fusion.},

CC has emerged as an on-demand accessible tool in different practical applications such as digital industry, academics, manufacturing, health sector, and others. Backup, security, processing, and localization are all issues that the cloud is dealing with. As a result, quantum computing has seen tremendous growth in several domains. In literature, the majority of those researchers working on quantum believe it will solve the cloud service issues. Quantum cloud computing (QCC) entails the deployment of quantum computation sources in a cloud environment to overcome the following challenges and concerns that the existing model of simple cloud computation faces. However, not everyone is interested in combining physics-based atomic computing with software-based CC. This study will demonstrate all of the probable benefits and drawbacks of quantum computing (QC) when used in conjunction with a cloud system. The same also cover some of the most recent updates, as well as some uncertain prospects for quantum as a cloud service. This work demonstrates the current state of the artwork in the quantum services domain.

Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Serverless computing is one of the most preferred deployment strategies in today’s world. It refers to a concept where execution environment is not predefined during deployment, but scaled based on demand. The concept has gained importance with improvements in cloud computing, which banks on this concept. Nowadays, cloud service providers are able to expose this concept as a cloud service itself, with application like GCP Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda. But as services go online, securing them becomes a challenge. Serverless computing was originally envisaged as a stateless environment, but now it has evolved to semi-stateful entities, making them prone to state analysis and hijacking. With current cryptosystems being outmatched at a fast pace, and quantum computing expected to break almost all cryptographic algorithms in the coming decade, it is imperative that serverless communications be encrypted in a much more secure fashion. A concept based on quantum key distribution and blockchain is proposed to improve application scaling and security. Blockchain platforms like Ethereum work based on smart contracts, which can execute pieces of code on the nodes and place results on the blockchain after consensus. The same can be adapted to serverless computing because smart contract codebase is deployed on the node itself, and is triggered by user requests. The user-defined function can then be deployed as a smart contract. When demand is huge, more nodes can be spun up, which contain the codebase for the smart contract, and they can initiate execution. In order to enhance security, the communication between endpoints can be protected by using Quantum Key Distribution, and even among the nodes, selections can be done using principles behind QKD. After execution is complete, the result is placed on the blockchain itself, which acts as a log of execution, as well as carry the result. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Modern healthcare systems are known for being extremely complicated and expensive. On the other hand, improved health record management can help lessen this. The Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing system is cutting-edge healthcare delivery. The system's tools can anticipate results throughout a patient's life, measure treatment efficacy, follow therapy, and detect human errors. Centralized and cloud-based systems are susceptible to security attacks and illegal modifications that can cause privacy issues and sometimes life-Threatening situations. Integrity and interoperability across the treatment continuum are top priorities for major industry players. Given the massive amount of EHR data, security concerns, and variety of healthcare information systems, achieving this aim remains a challenge. Blockchain is an immutable ledger used in EHR systems due to its inherent immutability and privacy attributes. Blockchain-based systems are reliable and efficient. Another advantage of the Blockchain application in healthcare record management is the increased interoperability of records that can further help in better availability of the patient's records resulting in better healthcare opportunities and collaboration. Quantum computing developments threaten such systems as quantum computers can easily break the algorithms assumed to be impossible to crack in years. This paper reviews the application of Blockchain in EHR, possible challenges, and quantum computers' effect on the reliability and security of Blockchain-based EHR systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since the creation of cloud computing and its widespread usage, data security was a significant problem. Different frameworks were suggested; however, data breaches still happen often. The advent regarding quantum computing suggests a pressing need to present a paradigm that would present acceptable data security for both conventional and quantum computings, as encryption is now the predominant approach related to cloud data security. As a result, although certain cryptosystems will withstand the test of quantum computing, the majority of cryptosystems will become vulnerable and out-of-date. In order to lessen the likelihood of Diffie–Hellman algorithm attacks and advance the New Hope algorithm to the next level, the study suggests a model that combines Diffie–Hellman (DH) and New Hope to key exchange between server and client. This suggested public-key exchange protocol depends on New Hope lattice-based cryptography. In this research, we expand the New Hope and DH algorithms with the use of algorithm of the DH for getting a stronger technique to transmit data further exchanged between receiver and sender such that for every message, a new approach to would be formed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2023.},

	abstract = {Load Balancing is the process of distributing the computing load equally among the available resources which are pooled. With the rapidly advancing information technology industry, load balancing becomes a necessity. The load balancer equally distributes the load between the available resources, the lack of load balancing makes the single resources to bare huge amounts of requests. It also makes the resources highly available for the users. Load Balancing is used in both on-premises and off-premises environments. The load balancing mainly depends on a certain algorithm for the operation. There are many load-balancing algorithms used. The most widely used algorithm is the load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. Each task in the Round-Robin Algorithm is carried out based on the time quantum. Although widely used, the Round Robin algorithm has some issues that are trying to solve using this research study. Some of the major issues focused here are the lack of dynamic time quantum allocation and more context switching and not prioritizing tasks. This research study initially reviews the cloud computing and its deployment strategies. Then, this research study presents a complete overview on the importance of load balancing, the most widely used load balancing algorithm with cloud environment, and its shortcomings. Finally, a research idea has been proposed for the enhancement of Round Robin load balancing algorithm. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Edge computing brings data computation and storage closer to the mobile device to save response time for decision making. After being processed at the edge, commonly the data will be uploaded to the cloud for further enriched analysis. For privacy concerns, local devices may encrypt the collected data before sending it to the cloud server. However, this treatment increases the server's processing time and makes it hard to pick out the desired data. In this article, to address this problem, we design an encrypted data validation scheme, which enables the edge to clean the encrypted data to be uploaded. Because edge computing encompasses numerous edge devices from different service providers, we explore the public-key cryptographic mechanism to implement our secure data validation scheme. Considering potential risks from quantum computers, we propose to leverage ideal lattice to realize our protocol, which reaches better performance in both time and storage for edge devices. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed proposal achieves considerable performance improvements in terms of communication and computation aspects. Particularly, compared to prior work, nearly 123×-238× speed up is achieved in our key derivation procedure and the storage cost of the secret key is reduced from 547MB to 1.7MB.  © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In today’s scenario of computing paradigm, the cloud framework has become a significant solution on peak of virtualization for the utilization of computing models. However, the model has the latent to influence users and organizations; there are several security issues over shared data. In existing models for cloud data security, several considerations are made. Still, there is a requirement for ensuring cloud storage security with Third Party Auditing and distributed accountability. For that, this paper develops a new model called Enhanced Cloud Security Model using Quantum Key Distribution Protocol (ECSM-QKDP), for providing cloud storage security and manage with data dynamics, quantum key cryptography is incorporated. Moreover, this work considers the scenario of communication between three entities such as, Cloud Server, Data Owner and Legitimate User (LU), in which the quantum keys are shared in two steps. In the first step, BB84 QKDP is used and in the second process, Secure Authentication Protocol is framed based on distance bounding and secure keys, which are generated here using Hierarchical Attribute-Set based Encryption. By utilizing the model, the secured keys are transmitted through trusted channel to the LU. The results show that the proposed model provides effective results than existing models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Fingerprinting is one of the most commonly used techniques for indoor localization due to their high accuracy in the presence of the wireless channel noise. Nonetheless, they require significant storage overhead and running time. This becomes even more important when scaling such systems to a worldwide scale.Quantum computing can speedup computation of intractable problems that are hard to solve on the traditional classical computers. In this paper, we propose a realistic quantum fingerprint based algorithm that builds on quantum computing concepts to scale. In particular, the proposed fingerprinting algorithm can provide exponential enhancement in both space and running time over the classical fingerprinting techniques. We explain the details of the quantum fingerprint construction, how to encode the fingerprint signal strength vectors in quantum states, and how to calculate the quantum similarity between the online signal strength measurement and the offline ones. In addition, we study the different practical implementation and deployment issues on IBM quantum computing cloud machines.Implementation and evaluation of our algorithm in a real testbed using quantum machines confirms its ability to correctly obtain the estimated location with an exponential enhancement in both time and space compared to the traditional classical fingerprinting techniques. This highlights the promise of our algorithm to scale fingerprinting localization to be used globally.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum k-means algorithm is widely used in solving clustering problems. However, the repeated calculation of the core subroutines overloads the quantum computer with mass computing tasks. In addition, due to the decoherence of the quantum state, the computing power of personal quantum computer is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to use high-performance quantum cloud computing to complete data processing. This paper proposes a quantum k-means algorithm in quantum cloud computing, which uploads the data to the server to execute the core subroutines SwapTest (calculating the similarity between ciphertext quantum states) and GroverOptim (quantum minimization algorithm) of quantum k-means algorithm and then sends the ciphertext to the client for further decryption using the decryption key, which reduces the load of the client. An improved quantum homomorphic encryption by t-gate updating in trusted server and data processing in semi-trusted server is introduced as well. In this scheme, the trusted server assists the semi-trusted server to execute the T-gate existing in the quantum circuit, which separates the key from the ciphertext and ensure the security of the ciphertext data processing in the quantum cloud. In our experiment, the two subroutines, SwapTest and GroverOptim, are conducted in ciphertext and plaintext conditions by using IBM Qiskit to evaluate the reliability and feasibility. The result shows that the decrypted ciphertext result is the same as the plaintext. We conclude that the proposed algorithm has a better performance in reducing the cost of load in client and protecting privacy data in cloud by contrast with the original quantum k-means algorithm. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In order to reduce the positioning error of wireless sensor network nodes and deal with the positioning of a large number of sensor network nodes, a mass sensor node positioning method based on particle swarm optimization (SNPSO) is proposed. The node location error of node distance correction value is corrected by SNPSO algorithm, and the sensing data is encoded by the index of cloud computing resources. The dynamic target strategy (DTS) algorithm is used to solve the strict deadline constraints. The algorithm focuses on optimizing execution time to meet deadline constraints, and once feasible solutions are obtained, it focuses on optimizing execution costs within deadline constraints. The performance of the algorithm is simulated and analyzed on the platform of MATLAB 2016. Compared with the sensor positioning method, SNPSO improves the positioning accuracy of mass sensor nodes. The simulation results verify the validity of SNPSO. Compared with the improved quantum genetic algorithm (IQGA) under different scale data scheduling and different deadlines constraints, the proposed algorithm can improve the positioning accuracy of mass sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm can find the optimal solution of cloud computing resource scheduling with lower execution cost under strict deadline constraints, and can more easily meet the needs of massive sensor network node location data processing. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

A quantum algorithm is developed to minimize the distance traveled in warehouses and distribution centers where order picking is applied. For this, a proof of concept is proposed through a Raspberry Pi 4, generating a quantum combinatorial optimization algorithm that saves the distance travelled and the batch of orders to be made. In case of computational need, the robot will be able to parallelize part of the operations in hybrid computing (quantum + classical), accessing CPUs and QPUs distributed in a public or private cloud. We developed a stable environment (ARM64) inside the robot (Raspberry) to run gradient operations and other quantum algorithms on IBMQ, Amazon Braket (D-Wave), and Pennylane locally or remotely. The proof of concept, when run in the above stated quantum environments, showed the execution time of our algorithm with different public access simulators on the market, computational results of our picking and batching algorithm, and analyze the quantum real-time execution. Our findings are that the behavior of the Amazon Braket D-Wave is better than Gate-based Quantum Computing over 20 qubits, and that AWS-Braket has better time performance than Qiskit or Pennylane. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {We observe a continuously increased use of Deep Learning (DL) as a specific type of Machine Learning (ML) for data-intensive problems (i.e., 'big data') that requires powerful computing resources with equally increasing performance. Consequently, innovative heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems based on multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs require an architectural design that addresses end user communities' requirements that take advantage of ML and DL. Still the workloads of end user communities of the simulation sciences (e.g., using numerical methods based on known physical laws) needs to be equally supported in those architectures. This paper offers insights into the Modular Supercomputer Architecture (MSA) developed in the Dynamic Exascale Entry Platform (DEEP) series of projects to address the requirements of both simulation sciences and data-intensive sciences such as High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA). It shares insights into implementing the MSA in the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) hosting Europe No. 1 Supercomputer Jülich Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS). We augment the technical findings with experience and lessons learned from two application communities case studies (i.e., remote sensing and health sciences) using the MSA with JUWELS and the DEEP systems in practice. Thus, the paper provides details into specific MSA design elements that enable significant performance improvements of ML and DL algorithms. While this paper focuses on MSA-based HPC systems and application experience, we are not losing sight of advances in Cloud Computing (CC) and Quantum Computing (QC) relevant for ML and DL. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The cloud environment comprised of distributed resources in a dynamic fashion, so this necessitates the need for developing optimal scheduling in cloud environment with the satisfaction of Quality of Service necessitated by the cloud consumer with the maximum profit to cloud providers. But the presence of impreciseness while scheduling cloud resources is the challenging issue of traditional scheduling policies. The main objective of this paper is to treat the vagueness in scheduling of cloud resources by designing Neutrosophic inference system for prioritizing incoming tasks and optimizing the resource usage by applying quantum cuckoo search cache management (INIS-QCSCM). This proposed work represents the parameters involved in resource scheduling by the means of Neutrosophic representation with the aim of reducing the response and execution time with maximize throughput which favours the profit of cloud service providers. Once the job is passed to the virtual machine (local schedulers) it is fine grained at the local host level by utilizing cache segmentation with the knowledge of quantum cuckoo search algorithm. The incoming task request is prioritized using neutrosophic inference model by considering impreciseness as the important factor. In local host memory management specifically cache assignment is done by cuckoo search-based model which selects the best cache allocation policy to optimize the resource utilization with quality of service. To prove the performance of this proposed INIS-QCSCM, its make span, degree of imbalance handling, energy consumption, execution time of each task and the hit ratio of the cache management are used as the evaluation metrics. The efficacy of INIS-QCSCM is proved by comparing it with existing classification models support vector machine, Fuzzy inference system and intuitionistic fuzzy inference system. As the outcome of the simulation results proved that INIS-QCSCM model provides potential resource scheduling with optimized resource usage in cloud computing by treating hesitancy, impreciseness and vagueness in adversarial situation of cloud paradigm. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.},

	abstract = {The four fundamental quantum phenomena of superposition, entanglement and tunneling are envisioned to give quantum computing the ability to solve complex problems in very low-resolution times as compared with classical computers. Quantum computing relies on various types of processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them. Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum computing software projects have significantly increased in areas where complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems, quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy, security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM’s existing Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach with advanced quantum cloud services. This paper presents a new approach to develop a sophisticated quantum ecosystem to enhance the user base and quantum computing applications. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Supporting a massive number of connected devices with 5G advanced technologies and innovating new techniques will surely bring tremendous challenges for trust, security and privacy. Therefore, secure mechanisms and protocols are required as the basis for 5G networks to address this security challenges and follow security-by-design but also security-by-operations rules. In this context, new efficient cryptographic protocols and mechanisms are needed in order to design and achieve information sharing and data protection protocols in 5G networks. In the literature, several security schemes based on unproven assumptions of computational complexity and mathematical models were proposed. However, the cryptanalysis is able to break most of the existing proposals in the presence of several weakest links in the designs. Recently, quantum walks (QWs)have been introduced as an excellent mechanism for generating cryptographic keys due to its nonlinear chaotic dynamical performance, high sensitivity to initial control parameters, stability and very large key space theoretically strong enough to resist various known attacks. This paper firstly proposes two efficient hash function mechanisms for 5G networks applications based on QWs, namely QWHF-1 and QWHF-2. Then, based on these hash functions, two efficient security protocols for securing data in 5G network scenario are proposed. Performance analyses and simulation results show that the proposed approaches are characterized with high security, efficiency, and robustness against several well-known attacks which nominate them as excellent candidates for securing 5G applications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

But due to security issues like lack of confidentiality, malicious insiders, it has not gained wide spread acceptance to store sensitive information. Researchers have proposed proxy re-encryption schemes for secure data sharing through cloud. Due to advancement of computing technologies and advent of quantum computing algorithms, security of existing schemes can be compromised within seconds. Hence there is a need for designing security schemes which can be quantum computing resistant. In this paper, a secure file sharing scheme through cloud storage using proxy re-encryption technique has been proposed. The proposed scheme is proven to be chosen ciphertext secure(CCA) under hardness of ring-LWE, Search problem using random oracle model. The proposed scheme outperforms the existing CCA secure schemes in-terms of re-encryption time and decryption time for encrypted files which results in an efficient file sharing scheme through cloud storage. © 2018 IEEE.},

Cloud platforms can offer Quantum Computing as a service, but more importantly, they are capable of offering the flexibility, inherent in architecture, to accommodate new developments in Quantum Computing. On the other hand, Quantum Computing in general and Quantum Cryptography (QC), in particular, can help in alleviating the security concerns associated with CC, which have prevented users from migrating to cloud.

But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Based on delegating quantum computing (DQC), a DQC model that adapts to multi-qubit and composite quantum circuits is given firstly. In this model, the single client with limited quantum ability can give her encrypted data to a powerful but untrusted quantum data server and let the data server computes over the encrypted data without decryption, where the computation is a quantum circuit composed of multiple quantum gates. Then, the client generates the decryption key to decrypt the computing result according to the circuit of computation. However, this model cannot meet the situation of multi-client accessing or computing encrypted cloud data in the cloud environment. To solve this problem, we let the client outsource key generation to a trusted key server, which composes the quantum cloud center with the data server. The clients only perform X and Z operation according to the encryption or decryption key. Then, combined with Grover algorithm, a quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud data based on delegating quantum computing is proposed in this paper. The data server mainly uses Grover algorithm to perform search computation on the encrypted data. Moreover, a concrete example of our scheme is discussed next, where the data server searches for 2 target items from 8 items of the encrypted data. Finally, security of our proposed scheme is analysed, which can protect the security of the data. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {Fog Computing based Radio Access Networks are a promising paradigm for 5th Generation wireless communication technology (5G) having edge devices endowed with some caching and storage capacity, as a key component for reducing caching burden on the cloud server and providing fast access and retrieval at F-UEs in a scenario where IoT based devices requiring ultra-low latency will be used extensively. The amount of static as well as dynamic data requests generated by these real-time applications will be unpredictable and unmanageable shortly causing fronthaul congestion. In order to avoid performance degradation of F-RANs in near future, cache resource allocation strategies to increase cache hit ratio, must be redefined in a further better way. Quantum computing, on the other hand, seems to be the future for every kind of classical computing problem having non-linearity and exponential growth of computation and memory with a linear increase in Quantum bits due to its parallelism. In this paper, AI has been engaged in an attempt to enhance the caching capability in F-APs by updating caching content intelligently in quantum regime, accelerating computational speed and facilitating limited storage concerns. To validate our proposed framework, certain simulations are carried out in MATLAB. The results show an inevitable outcomes for F-RANs performance up gradation. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Due to its robustness, quantum computing can enrich the classical with other dimensions, security and cryptic-natured. However, the awareness about how to fully bridge the classical and quantum communications is not fully realised. In other words, the quantum phenomena are not totally utilised within the classical dimension. This work rather discusses directions and evaluations for future quantum solutions to traditional cloud mobile networks. Particularly, using quantum correlation phenomena to enhance the performance of X2 application protocol (X2-AP) by reducing the signalling overhead regarding the delay and power consumption that classical cloud encounter. Through modelling the latency of both paradigms using 'MATLAB', this work promises a delay reduction when adapting quantum method into the cloud. This study also models the power consumption and energy efficiency of traditional and quantum-based cloud networks. This work also shows, via modelling the power consumption, that installing a quantum-based paradigm is not a power costly method; rather, it shows identical power and energy efficiency figures with a possibility of improvement.  © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.},

And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion 'shots' or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Searchable encryption plays a vital role in keeping data privacy of current cloud storage. Considering the security threat of trapdoor exposure, Emura et al. introduced a formal definition of kywords revocable public-kye encryption with keywords search (KR-PEKS), which satisfies trapdoor exposure resistance (TER) and trapdoor re-generability. However, there is little work on lattice-based searchable encryption schemes to have the above properties, while it was widely accepted that cryptosystem on lattice has the potential to resist quantum computing attack. In this paper, we give a model of KR-PEKS with novel security, called bounded TER, i.e., a bounded number (previously set) of trapdoors for per keyword are exposed, which cannot affect other keywords. Then, we propose a lattice-based KR-PEKS scheme with bounded TER and trapdoor re-generability and show that this scheme is secure under the hardness assumption of learning with errors (LWE) problem. Finally, we conduct some simulation experiments on our scheme and give a comparison, which indicates that our scheme has less computational cost than the prior arts. © 2013 IEEE.},

We propose a model-driven methodology that allows application developers, classical service developers, and quantum programmers to build hybrid enterprise applications collaboratively. As a result, quantum programmers and service developers can develop and publish quantum and classical components. At the same time, the application developers can discover, compose, configure and compose pre-built components to build and operate enterprise applications without intimate knowledge on the underlying quantum infrastructure, advocating knowledge reuse and separation of concerns. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {To save the local storage, users store the data on the cloud server who offers convenient internet services. To guarantee the data privacy, users encrypt the data before uploading them into the cloud server. Since encryption can reduce the data availability, public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is developed to achieve the retrieval of the encrypted data without decrypting them. However, most PEKS schemes cannot resist quantum computing attack, because the corresponding hardness assumptions are some number theory problems that can be solved efficiently under quantum computers. Besides, the traditional PEKS schemes have an inherent security issue that they cannot resist inside keywords guessing attack (KGA). In this attack, a malicious server can guess the keywords encapsulated in the search token by computing the ciphertext of keywords exhaustively and performing the test between the token and the ciphertext of keywords. In the paper, we propose a lattice-based PEKS scheme that can resist quantum computing attacks. To resist inside KGA, this scheme adopts a lattice-based signature technique into the encryption of keywords to prevent the malicious server from forging a valid ciphertext. Finally, some simulation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme and some comparison results are further shown with respect to other searchable schemes. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

Dynamical time evolution of quantum fields is a challenge that is beyond the capabilities of classical computing, but it can teach us important lessons about the fundamental fabric of space and time. Whether we may answer scientific questions of interest using near-Term quantum computing hardware is an open question that requires a detailed simulation study of quantum noise. Here we present a large scale simulation study powered by a multi-node implementation of qsim using the Google Cloud Platform. We additionally employ newly-developed GPU capabilities in qsim and show how Tensor Processing Units-Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) specialized for Machine Learning-may be used to dramatically speed up the simulation of large quantum circuits. We demonstrate the use of high performance cloud computing for simulating ℤ2 quantum field theories on system sizes up to 36 qubits. We find this lattice size is not able to simulate our problem and observable combination with sufficient accuracy, implying more challenging observables of interest for this theory are likely beyond the reach of classical computation using exact circuit simulation.  © 2021 IEEE.},

To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users’ selection in a ‘win–lose’ manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ‘win–win’ manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The powerful storage function and convenient service function of cloud computing attract more and more users to save their digit image on the cloud server. However, the insecure data transmission process of cloud computing may lead to the disclosure of user privacy. At the same time, the existing machine learning algorithms do not consider the privacy and security of digit image in the application process. To solve the above problems, a novel color image encryption scheme based on controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQW) and DNA sequence operations is proposed. CAQW is used as a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) to scramble pixel positions, and DNA encoding rule is used to replace the pixel value, and then the sequence of pseudo-random numbers generated by PRNG and DNA operation rules are used in two rounds of encryption of plaintext images. Our anlaysis and simulation show that this scheme can resist statistical analysis attack, differential attack and other attacks. In conclusion, the color image encryption scheme is robustness and efficient for protection of privacy image security. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In recent times, there has been a considerable increase in Cloud-Based applications and infrastructure. This has led to quicker innovations, agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet, improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic, scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to host the client applications and services. We present how the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are currently working on the final goal is to have a cross-platform advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud.  © 2020 ACM.},

Quantum principal component analysis algorithm is used as a method of quantum state tomography. We perform feature extraction on the eigenvalue matrix of the density matrix after feature decomposition to achieve dimensionality reduction, proposed quantum principal component extraction algorithm (QPCE). Compared with the classic algorithm, this algorithm achieves an exponential speedup under certain conditions. The specific realization of the quantum circuit is given. And considering the limited computing power of the client, we propose a quantum homomorphic cipher dimension reduction scheme (QHEDR), the client can encrypt the quantum data and upload it to the cloud for computing. And through the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme to ensure security. After the calculation is completed, the client updates the key locally and decrypts the cipher result. We have implemented a quantum cipher dimensionality reduction scheme implemented in the quantum cloud, which does not require interaction and ensures safety. In addition, we have carried out experimental verification on the QPCE algorithm on IBM's real computing platform. Experimental results show that the algorithm can perform cipher dimension reduction safely and effectively.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Access to a programmable CMOS-compatible Silicon spin qubit-based quantum processor will be provided in the next deployment phase. The first generation of QI's quantum processors consists of a double quantum dot hosted in an in-house grown SiGe/28Si/SiGe heterostructure, and defined with a single layer of Al gates. Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI's modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit.

It makes use of a Novel Quantum Key Distribution approach, which guarantees high level secured data transmission. Along with this, a shared secret is generated using Diffie Hellman (DH) to certify secured key generation at reduced time complexity. Moreover, a non-commutative approach is used, which effectively allows the users to store and access the encrypted data into the cloud server. Also, to prevent data loss or corruption caused by the insiders in the cloud, Optimized Genetic Algorithm (OGA) is utilized, which effectively recovers the data and retrieve it if the missed data without loss. It is then followed with the decryption process as if requested by the user. Thus our proposed framework ensures authentication and paves way for secure data access, with enhanced performance and reduced complexities experienced with the prior works. © 2020 Tech Science Press.

The multiple data are targeting to observe the data through a common platform, and then it becomes essential to investigate accuracy for realizing the best IoT platform. To address the growing demand for time-sensitive data analysis and real-time decision-making, accuracy in IoT data collecting has become critical. The Res-HQCNN is a hybrid quantum-classical neural network with deep residual learning. The model is qualified in an end-to-end analog method in a traditional neural network, backpropagation is used. To discover the Res-HQCNN efficiency to perform on the classical computer, there has been a lot of investigation into quantum data with or without noise. Then focus on the application of the artificial neural network to analyze the dangers to these IoT networks. For data recording purposes, to undertake in-depth analysis on the threat severity, kind, and source, a model is trained using recurrent and convolutional neural networks. The intrusion detection system (IDS) explored in this study has a success rate of 99% based on the empirical data supplied to the model. Due to irregularly distributed robust execution, larger affectability for the introduction of authority dimension, steadiness, and the extremely large crucial area, a quantum hash function work has been proposed as an amazing method for secure communication between the IoT and cloud. © 2021.

This paper focuses on the construction of a Docker container environment with Qiskit source codes and libraries running on a local cloud computing system that can directly access the IBM Q Experience. This prototype container based system allows single user and small project groups to do rapid prototype development, testing and implementation of extreme capability algorithms with more agility and flexibility than can be provided through the IBM Q Experience website. This prototype environment also provides an excellent teaching environment for labs and project assignments within graduate courses in cloud computing and quantum computing.

This paper also models the power consumption (PC) and energy efficiency of the traditional and quantum-based cloud networks.

IBM has been at the forefront by developing superconducting quantum devices and providing cloud-based services. Initially limited to gate level access, IBM now provides cloud servers to access pulse level control of quantum devices for their algorithms. In this paper, we compare the performance of gate level and pulse level quantum encoding, control and measurement on the single qubit IBM Armonk quantum computer. Specifically, for the simulation of Rabi and Ramsey evolution dynamics-key components of many quantum metrology and clock synchronization algorithms, we show that the ability to re-calibrate pulse frequency and amplitude in realtime for pulse access allows significant improvement in the simulation of these two dynamics when compared with the gate level access.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With recent advances made in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and Cloud Computing (CC), the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) find it advantageous in terms of improvement in quality and interactivity of urban transportation service, mitigation of costs incurred, reduction in resource utilization, and improvement in traffic management capabilities. Many traffic-related problems in future smart cities can be sorted out with the incorporation of IoV in transportation. IoV communication enables the collection and distribution of real-time essential data regarding road network condition. In this scenario, energy-efficient and reliable intercommunication routes are essential among vehicular nodes in sustainable urban computing. With this motivation, the current research article presents a new Artificial Intelligence-based Energy Efficient Clustering with Routing (AI-EECR) Protocol for IoV in urban computing. The proposed AI-EECR protocol operates under three stages namely, network initialization, Cluster Head (CH) selection, and routing protocol. The presented AI-EECR protocol determines the CHs from vehicles with the help of Quantum Chemical Reaction Optimization (QCRO) algorithm. QCRO algorithm derives a fitness function with the help of vehicle speed, trust level, and energy level of the vehicle. In order to make appropriate routing decisions, a set of relay nodes was selected using Group Teaching Optimization Algorithm (GTOA). The performance of the presented AI-EECR model, in terms of energy efficiency, was validated against different aspects and a brief comparative analysis was conducted. The experimental outcomes established that AI-EECR model outperformed the existing methods under different measures. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The large-scale multimodal sensor fusion of the internet of things (IoT) data can be transformed into an N-dimensional classical point cloud. For example, the transformation may be the fusion of three imaging modalities of different natures such as LiDAR (light imaging, detection, and ranging), a set of RGB images, and a set of thermal images. However, it is not easy to process a point cloud because it can have millions or even hundreds of millions of points. Classical computers therefore often crash when operating a point cloud of multimodal sensor data. Quantum Point Clouds (QPC) address the problem of uncertainty in multi-modal sensor data, such that precognitive/predictive models can be derived with outcomes of greater certainty than classical information processing methods. This paper presents early experiments of the first application of a quantum co-processor hybrid for processing quantum point cloud multimodal sensor data from an autonomous racing car. Applied to the more complex case of cave mapping, it then describes the first hybrid classical-quantum co-processor, comprising a graphical processing unit, differential pulse code modulator and a quantum computer. The graphical processing unit comprises a multiple input/output data interface, transformation means for transforming a fused depth bitmap of the multi-modal sensor data into a point cloud representation with world coordinates, control logic that manages the multiple input/output data interface, and the differential pulse code modulator. The quantum co-processor comprises an assembly of quantum computing chips. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

CQCSO is developed by applying chaotic theory and quantum theory to the standard Chicken Swarm Optimization to overcome its problem of premature convergence and local optima. CQCSO algorithm models the task scheduling as an optimization problem and solves it by formulating a multi-objective fitness function using task completion time, response time and throughput to ensure maximum Quality-of-service (QoS) satisfaction and minimum SLA violations. CQCSO identifies the task order and optimally schedules them to the suitable virtual machines with better performance.

Blockchain technology can be applied to guarantee safety and information transparency in data caching and trading processes. Therefore, a blockchain-based secure cost-aware data caching scheme is proposed to optimize the placement and prevent the tampering of cache data. In this scheme, under the constraints of transmission cost, edge cache size, a quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to solve the data cache placement problem with the greatest content caching gain. A blockchain-based secure decentralized data trading model is proposed to solve the trust problem among the buyers, sellers, and agent nodes and increase incentives for users to trade data. A double auction mechanism is used to maximize social welfare. The experimental results reveal that the proposed data caching and trading scheme can reduce the data transmission cost, improve the cache hit ratio, and maximize social welfare. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Quantum communication relies on the existence of entanglement between two nodes of a network. However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware. In this paper, we report the circuit-level implementation of the complete architecture of a quantum repeater and benchmark this protocol on IBM’s cloud quantum computer—IBMQ. Our experiments indicate a 26% fidelity of shared bell pairs for a complete on-chip quantum repeater with a yield of 49%. We also compare these results with simulation data from IBM Qiskit. The results of our experiments provide a quantitative measure for the fidelity of entanglement that currently available repeaters can establish. In addition, the proposed circuit implementation provides a robust benchmark for state-of-the-art quantum computing hardware. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Identity-based signature schemes enable any pair of users to communicate securely and to verify each other’s identity without exchanging private or public keys, without keeping key directories, and without using the services of a third party. Such paradigms are very suitable for an emerging scenario of Multimedia Social Networks (MSNs), in which there are a large number of users, dynamic interaction and huge content sharing. A revocable identity-based signature(RIBS) scheme, proposed by Tsai et al., provides a revocation mechanism for controlling user’s access dynamically. To capture a realistic and efficient scenario, In 2017, XiaoYing Jia et al. introduced an additional important component, called Cloud Revocation Server(CRS), where most of the computations needed during key-updates are of loaded to the CRS. With the surprising development of quantum computation technology in recent years, IBS schemes mentioned above, based on conventional number theory problem, would become vulnerable. Recently, lattice-based cryptography schemes were proved to be secure against quantum attacks. Although such efficient RIBS scheme based on Computational Diffle-Hellam Problem(CDH) assumption has been proposed, all the lattice-based RIBS do not achieve this realistic and efficient property. In this paper, we propose the first lattice-based RIBS with outsourced Cloud Service Provider(CSP). In our scheme, a user’s private key is composed of both an partial private key and a time update key. The time update key is periodically updated by CSP and is transmitted over a public channel. Based on the hardness assumption of Short Integer Solution (SIS), we demonstrate that the proposed lattice-based RIBS scheme with outsourced revocation in cloud computing provides existential unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks in the random oracle. As compared to the existing IBS schemes over lattices, our RIBS scheme has better performance in terms of energy consumption, signature size, signing key size, and the revocation mechanism with public channels. As the underlying lattice problem is intractable even for quantum computers, our scheme would work well in the quantum age. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

With growth of cloud computing, the risks of security and privacy are arising. Also, the cloud resources are not secure against quantum computers, as quantum computing threatens the best security controls implemented today, that include ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), RSA, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Fortunately, there are quantum-safe digital signatures called Hash-based Signatures, which can also protect integrity, authentication and privacy on the cloud. In this work, a hash-based digital signature scheme called WOTS is implemented to avoid security risks imposed by quantum computing on cloud computing. The implementation is carried out in CloudSim simulator. Apart from achieving quantum safety, the results show that our proposed solution is computationally cost effective.  © 2021 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK-CACSUK.},

	abstract = {To ensure the integrity of cloud storage, it is necessary for data owners to launch data integrity auditing (DIA) periodically. To fit more application scenarios, the research direction is shifted to design identity-based DIA (ID-DIA) protocols without expensive public key infrastructure, which can resist the quantum computing attacks simultaneously. However, the existing ID-DIA protocols are usually based on heavy anti-quantum computing cryptographies, which might severely limit their practical deployments. To address this problem, we explore three ways to design RLWE-based ID-DIA (ID-DIA-RLWE) protocols. The first is to improve the existing LWE-based ID-DIA protocols. The second is to enhance the existing RLWE-based DIA protocols. The third is to instantiate the proposed semantic ID-DIA protocol. Among these three proposed protocols, the third one is the most efficient due to its simplest construction. We also propose a new security model of ID-DIA protocols, including correctness assurance, security guarantee, and privacy protection. Then, we provide theoretical analysis of all proposed ID-DIA protocols under the given security model.

The assurance of confidentiality of the data stored in cloud storage and the exchange of data and sharing a key that is used to encrypt the data between two parties has been a major concern in the recent years due to the increased use of the cloud services. Also, to more security, we need to store the key away from the cloud and need data encryption in way that cannot break by the high computing like quantum computer. In this paper, we proposed a system that encrypts client’s data by an encryption algorithm, by using a key that is generated from Enhancement BB84 protocol, the data can be decoded only with the authenticated user that grants the key from Quantum Key Distribution Server (QKDS) over quantum channel and decrypts the data uploaded to the cloud. The simulation results show that our proposed system was effective in producing more security and less time in the process of data encryption and it provides a security for confidentiality of the user’s data in the cloud. © 2020 ICIC International.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this 'quantum advantage', a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {To reduce the burden and overhead of local storage, more and more organizations and individuals chosen to outsourcing data to cloud servers. Cloud users can access cloud data through any network. At the same time, as users lose actual control over the data, the data security in the cloud server is exposed to great risks. Therefore, how to ensure the integrity and security of cloud data has become an open issue. Around this problem, researchers have put forward many plans. However, these schemes are based on traditional cryptography, they cannot resist quantum attacks and have high computational complexity. It cannot meet the needs of interconnection of everything in the future. To solve this problem, we propose an identity-based outsourcing data integrity auditing scheme with lattice, which has forward security. Our proposed scheme is based on lattice cryptosystem, which not only has higher security and computational efficiency, but also has forward security. In the proposed scheme, the data owner can designate a proxy to outsource the data, thus reducing the local computing burden. In addition, we analyze the security of the scheme through the assumption of ISIS problem, which shows the theoretical security of the scheme. Theoretical analysis and comparison indicate that our proposed scheme is more secure and practical. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently. Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-Agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-Agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Existing classical ciphertext retrieval schemes are mainly developed according to the homomorphic encryption that is a cryptographic technique based on computational complexity theory of mathematical puzzles. In quantum computing, on the one hand, most of traditional asymmetric encryption can be quickly cracked as the computational capacity of quantum computer is much higher than that of traditional digital computer. Hence, the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme is widely used in data encryption for the issue of privacy protection in quantum computing. But on the other the retrieval efficiency of homomorphic encrypted data is insufficient especially in quantum cloud computing. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel quantum homomorphic encryption ciphertext retrieval (QHECR) scheme basing on the Grover algorithm to solve the problem of homomorphic encrypted ciphertext data retrieval in quantum cloud computing. Our scheme is to improve such retrieval efficiency mentioned above where the interaction process is not required even if the T-gate exists in the circuit. In the experiment, two qubits without the T-gate are conducted on both simulations and real quantum devices by using IBM quantum information science kit (Qiskit). The results show that the proposed QHECR scheme is capable of achieving the retrieval encrypted data when the T-gate does not exist in the evaluation circuit in ciphertext environment. Moreover, a verification experiment about the T-gate key update algorithm is implemented to verify the feasibility and reliability of the proposed scheme in the Qiskit as well, which indicates that the QHECR is still available when the T-gate exists in the circuit. Since the decryption is inefficient when there are exponential T-gates in the circuit, our proposed scheme is suitable for low T-gate complexity. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

For scrambling of the document image, we have considered the camera captured document images.

Peoples are using more and more electronic gadgets like smartphones and those things embedded with high definition cameras, by using the cameras people captures the many different kinds of images. In those images, document images are also present. For the fragile document, there is a need to capture to save the document information. Here in this paper, the safety of the document image is taken consideration. The document image may store in cloud computing environment or that document image may send or receive from one place to another. For this purpose, one should need to give the security of the document image. To resolve this security issues with document images this experiment is carried out. Once, the image is scrambled then it may store or transport anywhere without a problem. For the scrambling of the camera based document image, we have considered the Quantum Hilbert Image Scrambling method. After scrambling the image one can store in the cloud computing environment for the safer store and access to the document image. For the experiment we have used two kinds of datasets, IUPR standard dataset and our own dataset. The obtained results from this method are encouraging. © BEIESP.},

	abstract = {As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, efficient quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based on execution time estimations.Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by over 40% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  © 2021 Owner/Author.},

Recently, several scheme are proposed that combine encryption algorithms under the hardness of lattice problem with the structures of Attribute-based Encryption (ABE) to achieve resistance to quantum computing attacks. However, these schemes cannot realize secure user attribute revocation. To solve this problem, we construct an Efficient Revocable Attribute-based Encryption from R-LWE scheme (RABE-RLWE) in cloud storage. Our scheme is able to withstand quantum algorithm attack, and achieve data fine-grained access control. Moreover, RABE-RLWE scheme is able to achieve user attribute revocation by controlling user access rights and renew user attribute. In addition, under Ring-Learning with Error(R-LWE) assumption, it is proved that RABE-RLWE scheme is able to withstand chosen plaintext attack (CPA) under R-LWE assumptions. Finally, our scheme is more efficient than other related schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

While such noisy near-term quantum computing systems fall far short of the requirements for fault-tolerant systems, they provide unique test beds for exploring the opportunities for quantum applications.

	abstract = {As an emerging field that aims to bridge the gap between human activities and computing systems, human-centered computing (HCC) in cloud, edge, fog has had a huge impact on the artificial intelligence algorithms. The quantum generative adversarial network (QGAN) is considered to be one of the quantum machine learning algorithms with great application prospects, which also should be improved to conform to the human-centered paradigm. The generation process of QGAN is relatively random and the generated model does not conform to the human-centered concept, so it is not quite suitable for real scenarios. In order to solve these problems, a hybrid quantum-classical conditional generative adversarial network (QCGAN) algorithm is proposed, which is a knowledge-driven human–computer interaction computing mode that can be implemented in cloud. The purposes of stabilizing the generation process and realizing the interaction between human and computing process are achieved by inputting artificial conditional information in the generator and discriminator. The generator uses the parameterized quantum circuit with an all-to-all connected topology, which facilitates the tuning of network parameters during the training process. The discriminator uses the classical neural network, which effectively avoids the “input bottleneck” of quantum machine learning. Finally, the BAS training set is selected to conduct experiment on the quantum cloud computing platform. The result shows that the QCGAN algorithm can effectively converge to the Nash equilibrium point after training and perform human-centered classification generation tasks. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Many researchers proposed various techniques in order to improve the RR algorithm and selecting the optimal time quantum which plays a vital role to enhance this algorithm. This paper presents a review and new classification on these techniques. Studies have been classified into two categories: RR based on static quantum, and RR based on dynamic quantum. Furthermore, the second category was divided into dynamic quantum for each round and dynamic quantum for each process. Moreover, an analytical comparison has been provided.

	abstract = {Public-key encryption with conjunctive keywords search (PECKS) is an extension of public-key encryption with keywords search (PEKS), which can realize the efficient search of the encrypted data stored in the cloud server and keep the privacy of these data during the search phase. However, there exists an inherent security issue for the typical PEKS schemes that they cannot prevent the inside keywords guessing attack (KGA). Moreover, most PEKS schemes were constructed based on the hardness of some number theory problems which can be solved in polynomial time using the quantum computer. Thus once large-scale quantum computers are built, these PEKS schemes aren’t secure in the future quantum era. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a lattice-based PECKS scheme which can resist inside KGA. Its security can be reduced to the hardness of LWE problem and ISIS problem, thus it can resist quantum computing attack. We also give a comparison with other searchable encryption schemes on the computational cost of the main algorithms and the size of related parameters. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing simply means the advancement of distributed computing which takes data processing computational aspects over networks to centralized high-power data centers. It refers to the use of a centralized pool of resources that are distributed on a pay-per-view model to a large number of customers. This requires scheduling algorithms that allow us to define which task processes, among which resources are first allocated for performance. The Round Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm is the common scheduling algorithm used in multitasking and real-time environments. Its performance is largely determined by the amount of time it takes to carry out a specific task assigned by the CPU. If the less time is chosen the context switch is high and the higher time is chosen, the first-come first-server (FCFS) is selected. System's performance thus totally depends on the optimal quantum time to choose from. In this paper, I'm examining a different way of improving the performance of the round robin scheduling algorithm by means of a dynamic time quantum and comparison of different performance. © BEIESP.},

Different cloud quantum computing services deliver different architecture and performances. In our study, we conducted a research on some services to test and evaluate the performances of different cloud quantum computing services and make a comparison out of it. The test will be conducted using two different methods such as visual programming and qiskit. From the result, we can see that the amount of qubit per backend and shots per run pretty much affect the execution time of a cloud quantum computing.

Especially large volumes of image data, in medical and other domains, are produced. Cloud infrastructure is widely used to reap benefits such as scalability and availability. However, security and privacy of imagery is in jeopardy when outsourced it to cloud directly. Many compression and encryption techniques came into existence to improve performance and security. Nevertheless, in the wake of emergence of quantum computing in future, there is need for more secure means with multiple transformations of data. Compressive sensing (CS) used in existing methods to improve security. However, most of the schemes suffer from the problem of inability to perform compression and encryption simultaneously besides ending up with large key size. In this paper, we proposed a framework known as Cloud Image Security Framework (CISF) leveraging outsourced image security. The framework has an underlying algorithm known as Hybrid Image Security Algorithm (HISA). It is based on compressive sensing, simultaneous sensing and encryption besides random pixel exchange to ensure multiple transformations of input image. The empirical study revealed that the CISF is more effective, secure with acceptable compression performance over the state of the art methods. © 2021 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.},

Most of the existing classical optimization approaches, such as heuristic and metaheuristic have high computational complexity. In this work, we proposed a quantum optimization strategy that executes the tasks exponentially faster and with high accuracy named constrained quantum optimization algorithm (CQOA). We exploit the CQOA in RDMS as a toy example for pointing out the efficiency of the proposed quantum strategy in reducing energy consumption and computational complexity.

Recently, a link between quantum computing and kernel theory has been formally established, opening up opportunities for quantum techniques to enhance various existing machine-learning methods. We present a distance-based quantum classifier whose kernel is based on the quantum state fidelity between training and test data. The quantum kernel can be tailored systematically with a quantum circuit to raise the kernel to an arbitrary power and to assign arbitrary weights to each training data. Given a specific input state, our protocol calculates the weighted power sum of fidelities of quantum data in quantum parallel via a swap-test circuit followed by two single-qubit measurements, requiring only a constant number of repetitions regardless of the number of data. We also show that our classifier is equivalent to measuring the expectation value of a Helstrom operator, from which the well-known optimal quantum state discrimination can be derived. We demonstrate the performance of our classifier via classical simulations with a realistic noise model and proof-of-principle experiments using the IBM quantum cloud platform. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {As a result of the limited resources available in IoT local devices, the large scale cloud consumer’s data that are produced by IoT related machines are contracted out to the cloud. Cloud computing is unreliable, using it can compromise user privacy, and data may be leaked. Because cloud‐data and grid infrastructure are both growing exponentially, there is an urgent need to explore computational sources and cloud large‐data protection. Numerous cloud service categories are assimilated into numerous fields, such as defense systems and pharmaceutical databases, to compute information space and allocation of resources. Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) is a sophisticated approach which can permit employees to specify a higher level of security for data stored in cloud storage facilities. Numerous obsolete ABE techniques are practical when applied to small data sets to generate cryptograms with restricted computational properties; their properties are used to generate the key, encrypt it, and decrypt it. To address the current concerns, a dynamic non‐linear polynomial chaotic quantum hash technique on top of secure block chain model can be used for enhancing cloud data security while maintaining user privacy. In the proposed method, customer attributes are guaranteed by using a dynamic non‐ polynomial chaotic map function for the key initialization, encryption, and decryption. In the proposed model, both organized and unorganized massive clinical data are considered to be inputs for reliable corroboration and encoding. Compared to existing models, the real‐time simulation results demonstrate that the stated standard is more precise than 90% in terms of bit change and more precise than 95% in terms of dynamic key generation, encipherment, and decipherment time. © 2021 by the authors.

A large number of the current techniques are dependent on expensive Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). They cost computationally and communicationally heavy for verification which do not stand with the advantages when quantum computing techniques are applied. Hence, a quantum safe and efficient integrity verification protocol is a research hotspot. Lattice-based signature constructions involve matrix-matrix or matrix vector multiplications making computation competent, simple and resistant to quantum computer attacks. Study in this paper uses Bloom Filter which offers high efficiency in query and search operations. Further, we propose an Identity-Based Integrity Verification (IBIV) protocol for cloud storage from Lattice and Bloom filter. We focus on security against attacks from Cloud Service Provider (CSP), data privacy attacks against Third Party Auditor (TPA) and improvement in efficiency. © 2021 IEEE},

The 2021's challenges simply confirmed the necessity to secure all four elements of the IoT Model: Sensors, Networks, Cloud, and Applications. Therefore, it is important to be pragmatic regarding the extreme threats and high worth of attacks on secrecy in IoT systems. Although the concept of convergence of IoT and Quantum Computing is not a standby topic, it had been mentioned in several works of literature and coated by many researchers, however, nothing is getting ready for sensible applications thus far. Quantum Computing is not prepared nevertheless, it is so far from preparation on a billboard scale. Quantum computing resolves most of the issues in IoT however it occurs yet below the analysis phase and can take over a couple of years to induce in public obtainable use. During this research, the author will start through a broad introduction to the internet of things and Quantum Computing and carry on with issues that can be featured throughout the convergence of Quantum Computing and IoT. To solve these integration issues in terms of cryptography this research will also provide the answer. At long last, this research will call attention to the hybrid of both fields to existing IoT network design.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In mobile cloud computing (MCC), a large number of data are generated by mobile users and that data are sent to the remote cloud to make an additional process around the Internet. Due to this process, delay occurs because of long distance. In this paper, a task scheduling algorithm called as “ATSA: Ageing-based Task Scheduling Algorithm” is proposed for enhancing the total completion time, execution time, and throughput. ATSA algorithm has fix time quantum for the waiting task if the task exhausts that time period means automatically it considers as high priority task. Mainly why ageing concept is used means to avoid starvation. The comparative analysis between the existing algorithms and proposed ATSA algorithm is done. The evaluation results show total completion time, execution time, and throughput. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

It plays a critical role in achieving high-level performance and outstanding throughput by having the greatest benefit from the resources. Therefore, enhancing task scheduling algorithms will enhance the QoS, thus leading to more sustainability of cloud computing systems. This paper introduces a novel technique called the dynamic round-robin heuristic algorithm (DRRHA) by utilizing the round-robin algorithm and tuning its time quantum in a dynamic manner based on the mean of the time quantum. Moreover, we applied the remaining burst time of the task as a factor to decide the continuity of executing the task during the current round. The experimental results obtained using the CloudSim Plus tool showed that the DRRHA significantly outperformed the competition in terms of the average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time compared with several studied algorithms, including IRRVQ, dynamic time slice round-robin, improved RR, and SRDQ algorithms. © 2021 by the authors.

This study focuses on independent job scheduling in cloud computing paradigm. This paper devised a new enriched approach of chaotic quantum whale optimization algorithm (CQWOA), whose ultimate objective is to overwhelm degree of imbalance, increasing makespan and overheads in cost, energy consumption, resource utilization. With the intelligence of chaotic mapping and the quantum mechanism based optimal virtual machine selection, the global optima is achieved more significantly by CQWOA. This algorithm discovers best location and the direction to detect appropriate virtual machine in terms of reduced resource utilization, increasing makespan and evenly distributing the work load, makes the presented model to be more superior than Particle swarm optimization, Ant colony Optimization and standard Whale optimization. The existing models fails to handle the inconsistencies and vagueness in discovering potential virtual machine’s which qualifies their requirements and standard whale optimization easily meets earlier converge of local optima and it is very complex for them to reach global best virtual machines in cloud computing Paradigm. The proposed CQWOA model has saved the total execution cost in job scheduling more successfully and it is proved by its simulation results. © 2019, World Academy of Research in Science and Engineering.

	abstract = {The advent of cloud quantum computing has led to the rapid development of quantum algorithms. In particular, it is necessary to study variational quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, which are executable on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. Evaluations of observables appear frequently in the variational quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for NISQ computers. By speeding up the evaluation of observables, it is possible to realize a faster algorithm and save resources of quantum computers. Grouping of observables with separable measurements has been conventionally used, and the grouping with entangled measurements has also been proposed recently by several teams. In this paper, we show that entangled measurements enhance the efficiency of evaluation of observables, both theoretically and experimentally, by taking into account the covariance effect, which may affect the quality of evaluation of observables. We also propose using a part of entangled measurements for grouping to keep the depth of extra gates constant. Our proposed method is expected to be used in conjunction with other related studies. We hope that entangled measurements would become crucial resources, not only for joint measurements but also for quantum information processing. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Current Additive Manufacturing machines have limited techniques to observe process conditions and to decrease process errors. In order to overcome these limitations and increase the level and accuracy of machine intelligence, machine conditions need to be monitored more meticulously. A novel method for the condition monitoring of a 3D-printer is proposed in this paper. Quantum support vector machine (QSVM) is compiled for recognizing the health condition of the 3D-printer. The proposed quantum machine learning approach helps in monitoring the health state of the machine and classifies the same as healthy or aberrant. Classical machine learning approaches are inefficient to process the large amount of experimental data in real time. For better decision-making on such big data, quantum machine learning approaches are deployed which are much more efficient due to their exponential speed and parallel operation on complex sensor data, they show speedups in both the dimensionality and number of experimental data deployed to train the algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy in fault diagnosis than the traditional Support Vector Machine. All the numerical simulations and experiments have been carried out on a real quantum hardware provided by the IBM Quantum computing over the cloud. © 2021 The Authors.

	abstract = {IBM Q(https://www.ibm.com/quantum-computing/) represents a great opportunity offered by IBM to the quantum research community allowing running experiments, through a web interface, on several of their quantum systems on the cloud. One of the great technical challenges to making viable quantum computers is their qubit fidelity (quality/reliability) together with a plethora of error correction techniques—which, obviously, link to reliability theory. Hammock networks (a device-level alternative to gate-level reliability schemes) have shown outstanding reliability enhancements in the classical digital domain (e.g., about two-orders of magnitude better than gate-level von Neumann multiplexing). In spite of such performances, device-level reliability schemes in general, and hammock networks in particular, have never been assessed for quantum computations. A likely explanation is that device-level reliability seems much more akin to topological quantum computing concepts. That is why we have decided to test if and how much hammock networks might help in the quantum realm. Instead of theoretical analyses we have decided to perform simulations on(unfortunately still gate-level constrained), and we report our preliminary findings in this paper. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

Round Robin is a very simple algorithm in cloud computing environment but the disadvantage of round robin algorithm is long waiting time, long response time and overhead for context switches. In this paper, we have proposed a new dynamic round robin algorithm with execution time slice which is used to determine dynamic time quantum (TQ) for individual service request in every round. Here the priority has been used to calculate the Priority Component (PC) of the process.

	abstract = {Consolidating multiple virtual machines into a single server has been widely adopted in cloud computing to improve system utilization. However, the sharing of physical CPUs among virtual machines in consolidated systems poses a new challenge in providing an illusion of continuous CPU execution to the guest operating systems (OS). Due to the time-sharing of physical CPUs, the execution of a guest OS is periodically interrupted, while the guest OS may not be aware of the discontinuity of virtual time against the real time. The virtual time discontinuity problem causes the delayed processing of critical OS operations, such as interrupt handling and lock processing. Although there have been several prior studies to mitigate the problem, they address only a subset of symptoms, require the modification of guest OSes, or change the processor architecture. This paper proposes a novel way to comprehensively reduce the inefficiency of guest OS execution in consolidated systems. It migrates the short-lived critical OS tasks to dedicated micro-sliced cores, minimizing the delays caused by time sharing. The hypervisor identifies the critical OS tasks without any OS intervention, and schedules the critical code sections onto the dynamically partitioned cores at runtime. The dedicated micro-sliced cores employ a short sub-millisecond quantum to minimize the response latencies for consolidated virtual machines. By readily servicing the critical tasks, the proposed scheme can minimize the adverse artifact of virtual machine consolidation without any modification of guest OSes. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Node attributes such as MAC and IP addresses, and even GPS position, can be considered as exclusive identity in the distributed networks such as cloud computing platform, wireless body area networks, and Internet of Things. Nodes can exchange or transmit some important information in the networks. However, with the openness and exposure of node in the networks, the communications between the nodes are facing a lot of security issues. In particular, sensitive information may be leaked to the attackers in the presence of side-channel attacks, memory leakages, and time attacks. In this paper, we present a new notion of attribute-based hash proof system (AB-HPS) in the bounded key-leakage model, to be resistant to the possible quantum attackers. The notion of AB-HPSs is so attractive and powerful and can be considered as implicit proofs of membership for languages. We also give a construction of AB-HPS in lattices and prove the security of indistinguishability of valid and invalid ciphertext and leakage smoothness under the decisional learning-with-errors assumption. We also provide the general leakage-resilient attribute-based encryption construction using AB-HPS as the primitive without indistinguishable obfuscator. Finally, we discuss some extensions to improve the schemes in larger space for the message, larger alphabet for the attribute, and arbitrary access structure for the policy, respectively. We also give the performance evaluation in theoretic analysis and practical computation. © 2016 IEEE.},

Most of the existing task schedulers, did not achieve the required standards and requirements as some of them only concentrated on waiting time or response time reduction or even both neglecting the starved processes at all. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid task scheduling algorithm named (SRDQ) combining Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and Round Robin (RR) schedulers considering a dynamic variable task quantum. The proposed algorithms mainly relies on two basic keys the first having a dynamic task quantum to balance waiting time between short and long tasks while the second involves splitting the ready queue into two sub-queues, Q1 for the short tasks and the other for the long ones. Assigning tasks to resources from Q1 or Q2 are done mutually two tasks from Q1 and one task from Q2. For evaluation purpose, three different datasets were utilized during the algorithm simulation conducted using CloudSim environment toolkit 3.0.3 against three different scheduling algorithms SJF, RR and Time Slice Priority Based RR (TSPBRR) Experimentations results and tests indicated the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the state of art in reducing waiting time, response time and partially the starvation of long tasks. © 2017, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Quantum channels describe general transformations of the state of a physical system and play a fundamental role in many fields. It promises wide range of applications, because any physical process can be represented as a quantum channel transforming an initial state into a final state. The evolution of system undergoing a quantum channel is not necessary unitary which makes it unrealisable without ancillary system. Inspired by the method performing non-unitary operator by the linear combination of unitary operations, we proposed a quantum algorithm for the simulation of universal single-qubit channel, described by a convex combination of two generalized extreme channels corresponding to four Kraus operators, and is scalable to arbitrary higher dimension. We demonstrate the whole algorithm experimentally using the universal IBM cloud quantum computer and study properties of different qubit quantum channels. We illustrate the quantum capacity of the general qubit quantum channels, which quantifies the amount of quantum information that can be protected. There is a general agreement between the theoretical predictions and the experiments, which strongly supported our method. By realizing arbitrary qubit channel, this work provides a universal way to explore various properties of quantum channel and novel prospect of quantum communication. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this work, a high performance Grover algorithm simulation is proposed combining the characteristics of Grover’s algorithm and the parallelism of cloud computing, which dramatically improves the performance of the load balancing among multi-core, the utilization of memory space and the efficiency of simulation. Moreover, We propose five different computing configurations in the cloud environment suitable for quantum simulation and compare them through experimentation. We also validate the effectiveness of optimization by analysis and experimentation. The experimentation shows the simulation can reach 31 bits depending on the scale of current configuration. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

Therefore, a well-designed security mechanism should be carefully considered. This paper presents a new framework for secure information in fog cloud IoT. In the framework, the user in one location embeds his/her valuable data via the proposed quantum steganography protocol and uploads the covered data to the fog cloud. The intended receiver in another location accesses the data from the fog cloud and extracts the intended content via the proposed extraction approach. This paper also presents a novel quantum steganography protocol based on hash function and quantum entangled states. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior quantum steganography protocol that authenticates an embedded secret message. In the suggested protocol, the hash function is utilized to authenticate embedded secret messages. The presented protocol is secure against well-known attacks, such as message, man-in-the-middle, and no-message attacks. In addition, it does not consume additional channels besides the proposed one to send a secret message or verify security. The proposed approach is nominated for use in fog and mobile edge computing. © 2013 IEEE.},

We show in this paper how AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud computing platform can be automated in executing large-scale computationally expensive scientific experiments. Specifically, we show how quantum chemistry simulations can be executed in parallel and in a cluster-based fashion using the publicly available and popular Amazon cloud platform. With Amazon cloud, we were able to reduce the computation time by almost five orders of magnitude.

It has influenced a huge number of ventures, for example, government, broadcast communications etc. The Quality of Service (QoS) of a cloud specialist organization is a vital research field which envelops distinctive basic issues, for example, effective load adjusting, reaction time enhancement, culmination time change and diminishment in wastage of data transfer. This paper highlights cloudlet scheduling policy. The proposed policy CAMQU reduces the execution time of the cloudlet(s). The term UserFactor proposed within the policy gives power to user to make the process cost or time efficient on the basis of his needs whereas the term cost quantum a static value can be set by CSP to determine the cost of execution of the instructions of the cloudlets. The policy increases the Quality of Service (QoS) for both User and Cloud Service Provider. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.},

	abstract = {Cloud computing is one of the most emerging technologies which has created a revolution in the High performance Computing (HPC) domain. The term Quality of Service (QoS) plays a vital role in the formation of more f lexible integration of various technologies. The Waiting Time (WT), Turnaround Time (TAT), Context Switching (CS) and Makespan (MS) are the primary parameter that has great impact on the scheduling of cloudlets. The Proposed algorithm has improved the resource utilization system of the existing Round Robin Algorithm (RRA) and Improved Round Robin Cloudlet Scheduling Algorithm (IRRCSA) by introducing the concept of dynamically calculated Time Quantum (TQ) for each virtual machine (VM) according to the allocated cloudlets. This new approach in cloudlet scheduling drastically reduced average WT, average TAT and Number of CS of the VMs, which further enhanced the capability of cloud service providers (CSPs) to provide better QoS. © Allerton Press, Inc., 2018.},

	abstract = {We present direct performance measurements for four popular scientific simulations on the Knights Landing (KNL) platform. Performance numbers for Broadwell processors are provided for contrast. The applications (NAMD, LAMMPS, GROMACS and CP2K) were selected from among the ten most used in the QCT developer cloud as well as best representative of workloads used by many users and, given their diversity, should be representative of typical high performance computing workloads. All runs were performed with publicly available codes without modification and so results should be expected to improve as developers gain access to Knights Landing (KNL) processor. Current results are promising, with execution on a single KNL processor showing speedups up to 1.5x with respect to a dual socket Broadwell. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract = {Modern Cloud/Edge architectures are composed of computing nodes belonging to multiple layers, including Cloud facilities, Edge/Fog nodes and sensors/actuators. In this paper, we present an architecture that includes also quantum computing devices, in two ways:(i) quantum devices can become, in the next future, a viable alternative for executing computation that is intractable classically and (ii) they can be exploited to assist resource management and scheduling within the architecture itself. Furthermore, we describe the procedure through which a typical resource assignment problem, which has NP-hard complexity, can be transformed into a formulation that can be tackled by QAOA, a renowned hybrid quantum algorithm, and we present some preliminary results obtained for a simple instance, a knapsack problem where an Edge node needs to select and retrieve a set of processes from the Cloud.},

abstract = {This paper explores the emerging technologies of quantum computing, cloud computing, and cloud computing, focusing on their principles, applications, advantages, challenges, and interactions. Quantum computing has the ability to adapt to solving problems in many areas using the principles of superposition and entanglement, but it faces problems such as de-coherence. Cloud computing provides convenience and accessibility but also faces security and data transfer issues. Fog computing is a method that increases efficiency by distributing tasks near the edge of the network and has applications in the Internet of Things, smart cities, and data processing over time. This article introduces various types of quantum and cloud computing, including gate computing, adiabatic computing, topological computing, photonic computing, and quantum dot computing. Quantum computing enables quantum computing, advanced machine learning, cryptography, and cross-sectional innovation. Cloud computing enables increased efficiency, productivity and innovation across businesses, but it also faces security, data transfer and environmental issues. The interaction of technologies in the 3D printing industry highlights their importance in shaping the future of computer technology.},

abstract = {Quantum computing devices are usually demanding on the environment, with high operating conditions and maintenance costs. The supporting quantum computing operation software also has a high professional threshold. These make it more difficult to deploy and use locally. Cloud based quantum computing services will play an important role in computing power in the quantum era. At present, high-quality quantum computing QPU is scarce, which brings access needs of a large number of users. The computing tasks of a single user are too large, resulting in a large number of resources being occupied by a single user for a period of time, affecting the use of other users or tasks. A new quantum computing cloud platform task scheduling scheme is proposed to classify users and tasks and provide differentiated service opportunities. This scheme will enable high priority users to reduce waiting time and get a better experience.},

abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) has recently achieved significant technological advancements, attracting widespread attention. Current users mainly access QC resources through cloud services. However, cloud-based quantum services provide convenience while also introducing security risks. For example, attackers could steal private information or inject malicious programs into quantum devices, while quantum device fingerprinting may be the first step for these malicious intents. In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Driven Quantum Device Fingerprinting (TD-QDF) identification method based on quantum neural network (QNN) task outcomes. Unlike previous research, our method does not require any hardware details, resulting in high availability in practice. Extensive experiments involving 3 QNN circuits on 10 real IBM quantum computers show that our method can effectively identify quantum devices. This research contributes to advancing quantum fingerprinting technologies and holds promising implications for enhancing the security and accountability of quantum computing systems.},

abstract = {The rapidly growing interest in quantum computing also increases the importance of securing these computers from various physical attacks. Constantly increasing qubit counts and improvements to the fidelity of the quantum computers hold great promise for the ability of these computers to run novel algorithms with highly sensitive intellectual property. However, in today's cloud-based quantum computer setting, users lack physical control over the computers. Physical attacks, such as those perpetrated by malicious insiders in data centers, could be used to extract sensitive information about the circuits being executed on these computers. This work shows the first exploration and study of power-based side-channel attacks in quantum computers. The explored attacks could be used to recover information about the control pulses sent to these computers. By analyzing these control pulses, attackers can reverse-engineer the equivalent gate-level description of the circuits, and the algorithms being run, or data hard-coded into the circuits. This work introduces five new types of attacks, and evaluates them using control pulse information available from cloud-based quantum computers. This work demonstrates how and what circuits could be recovered, and then in turn how to defend from the newly demonstrated side-channel attacks on quantum computing systems.},

abstract = {In the last few years, the field of quantum computing has experienced remarkable progress. The prototypes of quantum computers already exist and have been made available to users through cloud services (e.g., IBM Q experience, Google quantum AI, or Xanadu quantum cloud). While fault-tolerant and large-scale quantum computers are not available yet (and may not be for a long time, if ever), the potential of this new technology is undeniable. Quantum algorithms have the proven ability to either outperform classical approaches for several tasks, or are impossible to be efficiently simulated by classical means under reasonable complexity-theoretic assumptions. Even imperfect current-day technology is speculated to exhibit computational advantages over classical systems. Recent research is using quantum computers to solve machine learning tasks. Meanwhile, the database community has already successfully applied various machine learning algorithms for data management tasks, so combining the fields seems to be a promising endeavour. However, quantum machine learning is a new research field for most database researchers. In this tutorial, we provide a fundamental introduction to quantum computing and quantum machine learning and show the potential benefits and applications for database research. In addition, we demonstrate how to apply quantum machine learning to the join order optimization problem in databases.},

Workable solutions require the design of hybrid quantum algorithms, where a quantum computing unit (a QPU) and classical computing (via CPUs) cooperate towards solving a problem. This demo illustrates such an end-to-end solution targeting NP-hard variants of database schema matching. Our demo is intended to be educational (and hopefully inspiring), allowing participants to explore the critical design decisions, such as the handover between phases of QPU- and CPU-based computation.

The main focus of this paper is on quantum computing technologies, as they can in the most direct way benefit from developing tools enabling the symbolic manipulation of quantum circuits and providing software tools for creating, optimizing, and testing quantum programs. We deliver a short survey of the most popular approaches in the field of quantum software development, pointing their strengths and weaknesses. This helps to formulate a list of desirable characteristics which should be included in quantum computing frameworks. Next, we describe a software architecture and its preliminary implementation supporting the development of quantum programs using symbolic approach, encouraging the functional programming paradigm, and, at the same, time enabling the integration with high-performance and cloud computing. The described software consists of several packages developed to address different needs, but nevertheless sharing common design concepts. We also outline how the presented approach could be used in tasks in quantum software engineering: quantum software testing and quantum circuit construction.},

Our findings revealed that model stealing attacks can produce clone models achieving up to 0.9 \texttimes{} and 0.99 \texttimes{} clone test accuracy when trained using Top-1 and Top-k labels, respectively (k: num_classes). To defend against these attacks, we propose: 1) hardware variation-induced perturbation (HVIP) and 2) hardware and architecture variation-induced perturbation (HAVIP). Despite limited success with our defense techniques, it has led to an important discovery: QML models trained on noisy hardwares are naturally resistant to perturbation or obfuscation-based defenses or attacks.},

abstract = {Smart Cities attract significant attention and investment from government and private entities, leading to their rapid development. With such growth in Smart Cities, data volume and diversity increase due to Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in devices. However, this abundance of data exposes millions of vulnerable devices to cyber threats, risking compromised security and sensitive information. To address these risks, Smart Cities utilize Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs) equipped with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms continuously monitor and protect against security incidents. Although Quantum Computing (QC) has shown promise in Smart City applications, its usage as a service is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose to investigate the utilization of Quantum as a Service (QaaS) to develop an architecture for securing a Smart City. Our approach employs Quantum Classifiers, QBoost from D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud and Variational Quantum Classifier, and PegaSoS Quantum Support Vector Classifier from IBM Quantum Services. These provide real-time data classification and a user-friendly dashboard to display security incidents in the Smart City. Among the three quantum classifiers considered for the proposed architecture, QBoost performed the best both regarding quality and processing time.},

abstract = {Quantum computers are currently accessible through a cloud-based platform that allows users to run their programs on a suite of quantum hardware. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ‚âà 30%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ‚âà .},

These environments aim to incorporate efficient data management and processing into distributed systems to minimize communication and computational costs, while simultaneously enhancing application throughput, reducing latencies, and prolonging battery life for nodes. Despite over a decade of research in this area, there are still numerous challenges that remain unsolved due to technological advancements such as lightweight virtualization, greater node capabilities, and increased parallelization.

abstract = {After decades of being mainly confined to theoretical research, Quantum Computing is now becoming a useful tool for solving realistic problems. This work aims to experimentally explore the feasibility of using currently available quantum computers, based on the Quantum Annealing paradigm, to build a recommender system exploiting community detection. Community detection, by partitioning users and items into densely connected clusters, can boost the accuracy of non-personalized recommendation by assuming that users within each community share similar tastes. However, community detection is a computationally expensive process. The recent availability of Quantum Annealers as cloud-based devices, constitutes a new and promising direction to explore community detection, although effectively leveraging this new technology is a long-term path that still requires advancements in both hardware and algorithms. This work aims to begin this path by assessing the quality of community detection formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem on a real recommendation scenario. Results on several datasets show that the quantum solver is able to detect communities of comparable quality with respect to classical solvers, but with better speedup, and the non-personalized recommendation models built on top of these communities exhibit improved recommendation quality. The takeaway is that quantum computing, although in its early stages of maturity and applicability, shows promise in its ability to support new recommendation models and to bring improved scalability as technology evolves.},

abstract = {Quantum programming languages (QPL) fill the gap between quantum mechanics and classical programming constructions, simplifying the development of quantum applications. However, most QPL addresses the inherent quantum programming problem, neglecting quantum computer implementation constraints. We present a runtime architecture for classical-quantum execution that mitigates the limitation of interaction between classical and quantum computers originated from the cloud-based model of quantum computation provided by several vendors, which implies a quantum computer processing in batch. In the proposed runtime architecture, we introduce (i) runtime quantum code generation to enable generic quantum programming and dynamic quantum execution; and (ii) the concept of futures to handle dynamic interaction between classical and quantum computers. To support our proposal, we have implemented the Ket Quantum Programming framework that features a Python-embedded classical-quantum programming language named Ket, the C++ quantum programming library Libket, and Ket Bitwise (quantum computing) Simulator. The last one improves over the bitwise representation, making the simulation time not dependent on the number of qubits but the amount of superposition and entanglement of simulation.},

abstract = {It has been long known that quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we find solutions of problems that are difficult to solve on classical computers. It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of cloud computing, an increasing number of companies are adopting cloud storage technology to reduce overhead. However, to ensure the privacy of sensitive data, the uploaded data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to the cloud. The concept of public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) was introduced by Boneh et al. to provide flexible usage of the encrypted data. Unfortunately, most of the PEKS schemes are not secure against inside keyword guessing attacks (IKGA), so the keyword information of the trapdoor may be leaked to the adversary. To solve this issue, Huang and Li presented public key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS) in which the trapdoor generated by the receiver is only valid for authenticated ciphertexts. With their seminal work, many PAEKS schemes have been introduced for the enhanced security of PAEKS. Some of them further consider the upcoming quantum attacks. However, our cryptanalysis indicated that in fact, these schemes could not withstand IKGA. To fight against the attacks from quantum adversaries and support the privacy-preserving search functionality, we first introduce a novel generic PAEKS construction in this work. Then, we further present the first quantum-resistant PAEKS instantiation based on lattices. The security proofs show that our instantiation not only satisfies the basic requirements but also achieves enhanced security models, namely the multi-ciphertext indistinguishability and multi-trapdoor privacy. Furthermore, the comparative results indicate that with only some additional expenditure, the proposed instantiation provides more secure properties, making it suitable for more diverse application environments.},

However, companies which are heavily investing in this new technology such as Google, IBM, Rigetti, Intel, IonQ, and Xanadu follow diverse technological approaches. This led to a situation where we have substantially different quantum computing devices available thus far. They mostly differ in the number and kind of qubits and the connectivity between them. Because of that, various methods for realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum computing device are available.

These include the IBM Cloud Application Lab (based on the original Apache VCL open source cloud platform), Learn@IBM (a Moddle-based collection of educational modules initially developed by CAS Canada Lab), a library of pre-packaged software images and platforms popular with many academicians, and more - integrated with many of the most requested IBM services (including IBM Watson and AI, IoT, blockchain and more).Many of these images, platforms and modules have been created in partnership with university collaborators for their specific academic needs (including the Apache VCL cloud platform itself). The IBM Cloud for Education is therefore intended to become a repository of cloud-based reusable assets that are being developed for courses or projects around data/AI, security, blockchain, quantum computing and more. Most importantly, these solutions can be easily hybridized with an institution's on-premise infrastructure or edge devices, can support any operating system or hypervisor - as well as Kubernetes - and can be accessed by a simple browser on any device. They can even be deployed within any third party vendor's hosted cloud.},

abstract = {In recent times, there has been a considerable increase in Cloud-Based applications and infrastructure. This has led to quicker innovations, agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet, improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic, scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to host the client applications and services. We present how the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are currently working on. The final goal is to have a cross-platform advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud.},

Prior generations based their security and privacy principally on symmetric key cryptography. The Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) and its successors contain a shared key used to authenticate the User Equipment (UE) to the network, and vice versa.However 5G is shifting its core network over to a microservices, cloud-first architecture and is heavily leveraging protocols like TLS and OAuth2.0 to authenticate and authorize transactions. As a result, it is shifting to a PKI-based trust model. This shift is happening just as quantum computing threatens to unravel the security of traditional ciphers such as RSA and ECC.In this paper we highlight the need to advance the 3GPP 5G standards and NIST post-quantum cryptography standards in tandem, with the goal of launching a "quantum ready" 5G core network.},

Here, to avoid repetition, we assume that readers have already read the latter message and will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous one. These include: (1) developing and utilizing an automated format violation identifier script focused on uncovering disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (2) incorporating authors-declared best-matching topics into our review assignment process; (3) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings, which necessitated additional managerial involvement in online dissensions; and (4) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it, and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Key statistics of the ASPLOS'24 summer cycle include: 409 submissions were finalized (about 1.5x more than last year's summer count and nearly 2.4x more than our spring cycle), with 107 related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 97 to machine learning, 88 to storage/memory, 80 to security, and 69 to datacenter/cloud; 179 (44%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 54 (13.2%) papers were accepted (with 20 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 33 (8.1%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions, of which 27 were subsequently accepted during the fall cycle (with 13 awarded one or more artifact evaluation badges); 1,499 reviews were uploaded; and 5,557 comments were generated during online discussions.Analyzing the per-submission most-related broader areas of research, which we asked authors to associate with their work in the submission form, revealed that 71%, 47%, and 28% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, with about 45% being "interdisciplinary" submissions (associated with more than one area).

abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) for cloud computing access control is reviewed in this article. A taxonomy and comprehensive assessment criteria of ABE are first proposed. In the taxonomy, ABE schemes are assorted into key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) schemes, ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes, anti-quantum ABE schemes, and generic constructions. In accordance with cryptographically functional features, CP-ABE is further divided into nine subcategories with regard to basic functionality, revocation, accountability, policy hiding, policy updating, multi-authority, hierarchy, offline computation, and outsourced computation. In addition, a systematical methodology for discussing and comparing existing ABE schemes is proposed. For KP-ABE and each type of CP-ABE, the corresponding access control scenario is presented and explained by concrete examples. Specifically, the syntax of ABE is given followed by the adversarial model and security goals. ABE schemes are discussed according to the design strategies and special features and are compared in the light of the proposed assessment criteria with respect to security and performance. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, this article not only provides a broader 12 categories of ABE schemes, but also makes a more comprehensive and holistic comparison. Finally, a number of open research challenges in ABE are pointed out.},

abstract = {With SDN/NFV, the telecom industry embraces operational flexibility and cost optimization, while facing new risks from off-premise cloud computing, known as introspection by malicious operators. Introspection is identified as a serious risk only by the IT industry in general when considering cloud operation. To mitigate it, processor vendors have invested in the last decade to design Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) plugged into their processor architectures. TEEs bring a quantum hardware-level security higher than any software-based security. They are all essentially aimed at protecting data and code when executed and processed in the cloud or in untrusted environment. In this paper, we emphasize on the blocking factors for the use of TEEs today: processor market fragmentation, major architectural and design deviations between TEEs from various CPU vendors and finally, a relatively complex enablement of these TEE technologies for non-security experts. We describe a code interpretation solution to break those blocking factors by providing a universal abstraction layer for TEEs. The paper gives a conceptual blueprint of a solution that enables Intel's SGX and AMD's SEV, defined as the most contemplated candidates in this paper for SDN/NFV or 5G deployment. Our study presents the key challenges and advanced functionalities we view as essential for meeting key SDN/NFV requirements and which are deploy ability, software performance and easy setup. Innovative directions are given to deal efficiently with these upcoming requirements.},

abstract = {Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that "squeeze" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are "interdisciplinary," namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%‚Äì22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted.

abstract = {Consolidating multiple virtual machines into a single server has been widely adopted in cloud computing to improve system utilization. However, the sharing of physical CPUs among virtual machines in consolidated systems poses a new challenge in providing an illusion of continuous CPU execution to the guest operating systems (OS). Due to the time-sharing of physical CPUs, the execution of a guest OS is periodically interrupted, while the guest OS may not be aware of the discontinuity of virtual time against the real time. The virtual time discontinuity problem causes the delayed processing of critical OS operations, such as interrupt handling and lock processing. Although there have been several prior studies to mitigate the problem, they address only a subset of symptoms, require the modification of guest OSes, or change the processor architecture. This paper proposes a novel way to comprehensively reduce the inefficiency of guest OS execution in consolidated systems. It migrates the short-lived critical OS tasks to dedicated micro-sliced cores, minimizing the delays caused by time sharing. The hypervisor identifies the critical OS tasks without any OS intervention, and schedules the critical code sections onto the dynamically partitioned cores at runtime. The dedicated micro-sliced cores employ a short sub-millisecond quantum to minimize the response latencies for consolidated virtual machines. By readily servicing the critical tasks, the proposed scheme can minimize the adverse artifact of virtual machine consolidation without any modification of guest OSes.},

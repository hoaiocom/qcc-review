  abstract={Cloud computing has become an integral part of modern information technology infrastructure, providing scalability and flexibility to meet the demands of various applications. However, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in cloud services is crucial for maintaining uninterrupted operations. Load balancing plays a vital role in distributing traffic efficiently across multiple servers to avoid overload and minimize service disruptions. Existing load balancing techniques require help to adapt to dynamic workloads, making them less reliable in cloud environments. Quantum computing handles complex optimization problems and offers a promising avenue for enhancing load balancing in the cloud. This research explores the concept of Fault-Tolerant Load Balancing (FTLB) in cloud computing with the integration of quantum computing. It investigates how quantum algorithms can optimize load-balancing decisions in real-time, considering dynamic workloads and server failures– the proposed novel quantum-load balancing (NQ-LB) algorithm designed to improve fault tolerance and resource utilization. The study employs a comparative analysis, evaluating the performance of the quantum-inspired load-balancing approach against classical load-balancing methods. We consider factors such as response time, resource allocation, fault tolerance, and scalability in a cloud computing environment. The results reveal the potential benefits of quantum computing in achieving fault-tolerant load balancing, particularly in scenarios with rapidly changing workloads and server failures. This research contributes to the advancement of cloud computing by harnessing the capabilities of quantum computing to enhance fault tolerance and load balancing. The findings can have implications for industries that rely on highly available cloud services, offering a more resilient infrastructure for critical applications.},

  abstract={Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs.},

  abstract={With the deeply studied of quantum computing by research fellows, the computational complexity and time complexity of quantum algorithms gradually increase. The quantum computing simulator provides an effective platform for the development and verification of quantum algorithms. However, the running time and memory overhead during calculation will increase exponentially with the number of qubits. Therefore, the difficulty of high-speed quantum computing on classical computers will gradually increase. At present, a single node has been unable to meet the resource requirements of the algorithm in the quantum computing process, and it is necessary to expand the memory resources in the multi-node computing cluster. Message passing interface has high performance inter-process communication capabilities, which can balance the data transmission between different hosts. Quantum computing tasks can be distributed on several servers to work together to solve the same problem. Therefore, this paper designs an advanced scheme of deploying quantum computing programs on cloud computing platform to support message exchanging between servers using message passing interface to accelerate quantum computing.},

  abstract={The emerging availability of quantum compute resources fosters the examination of its exploitation possibilities in different scientific domains, like artificial intelligence, manufacturing or finance. A significant number of research scientists primarily rely on cloud computing infrastructures while conducting research, whereas access to real (mostly remote) quantum hardware resources requires the deployment and proper configuration of different software components. In this paper we present a hybrid, cloud-based reference architecture that lowers the entry barrier to start new experiments with a wide range of quantum compute resources. The solution facilitates the execution of distributed quantum computing simulations in traditional cloud environments, and also access to several remote quantum compute resources. The reference architecture is highly portable to various cloud platforms, resulting in efficient adaptation and application possibilities by research communities.

  abstract={Load Balancing is the process of distributing the computing load equally among the available resources which are pooled. With the rapidly advancing information technology industry, load balancing becomes a necessity. The load balancer equally distributes the load between the available resources, the lack of load balancing makes the single resources to bare huge amounts of requests. It also makes the resources highly available for the users. Load Balancing is used in both on-premises and off-premises environments. The load balancing mainly depends on a certain algorithm for the operation. There are many load-balancing algorithms used. The most widely used algorithm is the load balancing algorithm is Round Robin. Each task in the Round-Robin Algorithm is carried out based on the time quantum. Although widely used, the Round Robin algorithm has some issues that are trying to solve using this research study. Some of the major issues focused here are the lack of dynamic time quantum allocation and more context switching and not prioritizing tasks. This research study initially reviews the cloud computing and its deployment strategies. Then, this research study presents a complete overview on the importance of load balancing, the most widely used load balancing algorithm with cloud environment, and its shortcomings. Finally, a research idea has been proposed for the enhancement of Round Robin load balancing algorithm.},

  abstract={Nowadays, data transfer has been vast online and on social media. Hence data security in the various cloud environments has been enabled to send and receive data. While transferring the data, some issues in the cloud environment are the lack of connectivity, control, and the insecurity of the password and the data. To handle this problem, data security and the internet connection have to be enabled for the cloud environments. The method of homomorphic encryption and the transport layer security protocol have been enabled for the analysis. The homomorphic encryption method converts the data to the ciphertext for making the text in the original format. Then the transport layer security protocol is used to authenticate the data, and the data integrity of the communication can be executed. The proposed system performs better than current protocols like Dynamic Level Based Integrity Checking Protocol, TLS protocol, and Lightweight Cryptosystem, making it a potential option for jobs involving safe and effective cloud information processing. Overall, the proposed Two-tier Homomorphic Encryption system exhibits improved execution time, security strength, resource utilization, communication overhead, and user satisfaction. It addresses issues such as connectivity gaps, control deficiencies, and password and data insecurity, making it an effective method for boosting cloud security in quantum cloud computing environments.},

  abstract={Cloud computing has revolutionized organizational operations by providing convenient, on-demand access to resources. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has introduced a new paradigm for collaborative computing, leveraging sensors and devices that generate and process vast amounts of data, thereby resulting in challenges related to scalability and security, making the significance of conventional security methods even more pronounced. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a novel Scalable and Secure Cloud Architecture (SSCA) that integrates IoT and cryptographic techniques, aiming to develop scalable and trustworthy cloud systems, thus enabling multi-user systems and facilitating simultaneous access to cloud resources by multiple users. The design adopts a decentralized approach, utilizing multiple cloud nodes to handle user requests efficiently and incorporates Multicast and Broadcast Rekeying Algorithm (MBRA) to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of user information, utilizing a hybrid cryptosystem that combines MBRA, Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and blockchain technology. Leveraging IoT devices, the architecture gathers data from distributed sensing resources and ensures the security of collected information through robust MBRA-PQC encryption algorithms, while the blockchain ensures that the confidential data is stored in distributed and immutable records. The proposed approach is applied to several datasets and the effectiveness is validated through various performance metrics, including response time, throughput, scalability, security, and reliability. The results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed SSCA, showcasing a notable reduction in response time by 1.67 seconds and 0.97 seconds for 250 and 1000 devices, respectively, in comparison to the MHE-IS-CPMT. Likewise, SSCA demonstrated significant improvements in the AUC values, exhibiting enhancements of 6.30%, 6.90%, 7.60%, and 7.30% at the 25-user level, and impressive gains of 5.20%, 9.30%, 11.50%, and 15.40% at the 50-user level when compared to the MHE-IS-CPMT, EAM, SCSS, and SHCEF models, respectively.},

  abstract={As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion “shots” or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.},

  abstract={The popularity of cloud computing platforms has risen dramatically in recent years. As cloud computing serves millions of users at the same time, it must be able to handle all those users' demands efficiently. Thus, choosing a suitable scheduling algorithm is crucial in the cloud computing environment in order to ensure efficient performance with a reasonable degree of quality of service (QoS). The primary goal of this research is to empirically implement and evaluate a recently proposed Round-Robin algorithm with smart time quantum (RR-STQ) in a cloud computing environment, as well as, to enhance the RR-STQ with a dynamic smart time quantum. The CloudSim tool was used to simulate the cloud computing platform to implement RR-STQ and evaluate it with several algorithms using different scenarios. In addition, three scheduling performance metrics were used in the evaluation process. In all comparison scenarios, the (RR-STQ) achieved a significant improvement rate in terms of average response time (RT). Moreover, (RR-STQ) has a better performance in the average turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), and response time (RT) than the traditional RR algorithm. Also, the implemented algorithm (RR-STQ) with dynamic time quantum has a better performance than static time quantum. Based on the evaluation results, it is beneficial to integrate the RR algorithm with other scheduling models such as shortest job first (SJF) to enhance the WT and TAT. Furthermore, the investigations revealed that the dynamic time quantum improves the performance of the RR algorithm.},

  abstract={The quantum cloud computing paradigm presents unique challenges in task placement due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of quantum computation resources. Traditional heuristic approaches fall short in adapting to the rapidly evolving landscape of quantum computing. This paper proposes DRLQ, a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)- based technique for task placement in quantum cloud computing environments, addressing the optimization of task completion time and quantum task scheduling efficiency. It leverages the Deep Q Network (DQN) architecture, enhanced with the Rainbow DQN approach, to create a dynamic task placement strategy. This approach is one of the first in the field of quantum cloud resource management, enabling adaptive learning and decision-making for quantum cloud environments and effectively optimizing task placement based on changing conditions and resource availability. We conduct extensive experiments using the QSimPy simulation toolkit to evaluate the performance of our method, demonstrating substantial improvements in task execution efficiency and a reduction in the need to reschedule quantum tasks. Our results show that utilizing the DRLQ approach for task placement can significantly reduce total quantum task completion time by 37.81 % to 72.93% and prevent task rescheduling attempts compared to other heuristic approaches.},

  abstract={A truly universal quantum computer is still on the small scale at the present. There has been no transition from the laboratory use of quantum computers to more widespread use of the technology. As a result, quantum simulation has emerged as the accepted norm for supporting the validation of quantum algorithms. Many conventional algorithms benefit from grover's quantum search method because it accelerates their usage of search heuristics. For better multi-core load balancing, memory utilization, and simulation efficiency, this research presented a high-performance grover method simulation that combines the benefits of grover's technique with the parallel of cloud computing. This study also suggests and experimentally compares five distinct cloud-based computing architectures that are well-suited to quantum simulation. Through research and testing, this study also verifies the optimization's efficiency. Depending on the size of the current configuration, the experimental results reveal that the simulation can reach 31 bits.},

  abstract={Quantum processing units (QPUs) are currently exclusively available from cloud vendors. However, with recent advancements, hosting QPUs will soon be possible everywhere. Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work.},

  abstract={Cloud computing is swiftly developing, delivering a diverse spectrum of computing utilities like databases, storage, and servers. It transfigures the way data storage is done and securely circulated among numerous users. Nevertheless, enabling privacy and restricting identity breaches when availing cloud utilities is essential. Fog Computing, an updated version of the cloud framework, utilizes a decentralized architecture to maintain data between the cloud and the data sources. This procedure seeks to improve performance, network connectivity, and most importantly provide security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is employed in fog computing architectures to develop and circulate keys. The employed keys change their quantum configurations, enabling them to be highly safe. Further, an intermediary maintaining the key can identify any endeavor by illegal entities to operate it. In this research article, we utilize sugar-salt encryption, an approach designed to oppose brute-force invasions efficiently. This encryption procedure delivers erroneous data in reply to wrong password/key insertions, improving data protection, which is pivotal in online based banking data protection.},

  abstract={Attribute-based encryption is a valuable technique for ensuring data privacy and confidentiality in the realm of cloud computing. Using this cryptographic primitive, the data owner can securely store and share data within the cloud environment. On the other hand, in recent years, extensive advances have been made in quantum processors, which have raised hopes of solving certain mathematical problems includes factoring integers and computing discrete logarithms of large numbers. The advent of quantum computers has posed a significant security threat to existing cryptographic protocols. The existing post-quantum attribute-based encryption schemes have not satisfied the essential features such as verifiability, user privacy and user revocability, simultaneously. In this paper, we present the first secure, practical and post-quantum attribute-based encryption scheme based on rank metric codes. Our scheme enjoys all mentioned features due to utilization of low rank parity check codes. The proposed scheme provides security against chosen plaintext attacks in the standard model, as well as resistance against reaction attacks as a kind of chosen ciphertext attacks. Moreover, at the 256-bit security level, the key size is about 16.5 KB, with an execution time of around 31.2 ms on a desktop. Our implementation results confirm that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing post-quantum and classical schemes.},

  abstract={For a specific quantum chip, multi-programming improves overall throughput and resource utilization. Previous studies on mapping multiple programs often lead to resource under-utilization, high error rate, and low fidelity. This paper proposes QuCloud, a new approach for mapping quantum programs in the cloud environment. We have three new designs in QuCloud. (1) We leverage the community detection technique to partition physical qubits among concurrent quantum programs, avoiding the waste of robust resources. (2) We design X-SWAP scheme that enables inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated with critical gates to reduce the SWAP overheads. (3) We propose a compilation task scheduler that schedules concurrent quantum programs to be compiled and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. We evaluate our work on publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated quantum chip IBMQ50. Our work outperforms the state-of-the-art work for multi-programming on fidelity and compilation overheads by 9.7% and 11.6%, respectively.},

For this application, a compact embedded processor board handles simple operations like data acquisition and pre-processing while a quantum cloud server is used to perform quantum computing simulations. This experimental setup is well suited for quantum computing as it is not feasible to embed a quantum processor at the edge, but practical to interface embedded processor boards to a quantum cloud server for processing massive audio data for a variety of recognition tasks. We found that distributing the task between the embedded processor and quantum sever enabled the application of QNN's to live audio data at the expense of system response time.},

  abstract={At present, in the face of the huge and complex data in cloud computing, the parallel computing ability of quantum computing is particularly important. Quantum principal component analysis algorithm is used as a method of quantum state tomography. We perform feature extraction on the eigenvalue matrix of the density matrix after feature decomposition to achieve dimensionality reduction, proposed quantum principal component extraction algorithm (QPCE). Compared with the classic algorithm, this algorithm achieves an exponential speedup under certain conditions. The specific realization of the quantum circuit is given. And considering the limited computing power of the client, we propose a quantum homomorphic ciphertext dimension reduction scheme (QHEDR), the client can encrypt the quantum data and upload it to the cloud for computing. And through the quantum homomorphic encryption scheme to ensure security. After the calculation is completed, the client updates the key locally and decrypts the ciphertext result. We have implemented a quantum ciphertext dimensionality reduction scheme implemented in the quantum cloud, which does not require interaction and ensures safety. In addition, we have carried out experimental verification on the QPCE algorithm on IBM's real computing platform. Experimental results show that the algorithm can perform ciphertext dimension reduction safely and effectively.},

  abstract={Quantum computing is a promising paradigm to solve computationally intractable problems. Various companies such as, IBM, Rigetti and D-Wave offer quantum computers using a cloud-based platform that possess several interesting features namely, (i) quantum hardware with various number of qubits and coupling maps exist at the cloud end that offer different computing capabilities; (ii) multiple hardware with identical coupling maps exist in the suite; (iii) coupling map of larger hardware with more number of qubits can fit the coupling map of many smaller hardware; (iv) the quality of each of the hardware is distinct; (v) user cannot validate the origination of the result obtained from a quantum hardware. In other words, the user relies on the scheduler of the cloud provider to allocate the requested hardware; (vi) the queue of quantum programs at the cloud end is typically long and maximizing the throughput, which is the key to reducing costs and helping the scientific community in their explorations. The above factors motivate a new threat model with following possibilities: (a) in future, less-trustworthy quantum computers from 3rd parties can allocate poor quality hardware to save on cost or towards satisfying their falsely-advertised qubit or quantum hardware specifications; (b) the workload scheduling algorithm could have a bug or malicious code segment which will try to maximize throughput at the cost of allocation to poor fidelity hardware. Such bugs are possible for trustworthy providers; (c) a rogue employee in trusted cloud vendor could try to sabotage the vendor's reputation by degrading the user compute fidelity just by tampering with the scheduling algorithm or rerouting the program; (d) a rogue employee can steal information by redirecting the programs to a 3rd party quantum hardware where they have full control. If the allocated hardware is inferior in quality, the user will suffer from poor quality result or longer convergence time. We propose two flavors of a Quantum Physically Unclonable Function (QuPUF) to address this issue- one based on superposition and another based on decoherence. Our experiments on real quantum hardware reveal that temporal variations in qubit quality can degrade the quality of the proposed QuPUF. We add a parametric rotation to the QuPUF for stability. Experiments on real IBM quantum hardware show that the proposed QuPUF can achieve inter-die Hamming Distance (HD) of 55% and intra-HD as low as 4%, as compared to ideal cases of 50% and 0% respectively. The proposed QuPUFs can also be used as a standalone solution for any other application.},

  abstract={Quantum computers have garnered significant attention recently, owing to their potential to surpass the computational capabilities of classical systems. However, stringent operational requirements render quantum computing devices inherently costly. To democratize access to quantum computers, efforts have been made to make these devices accessible via cloud platforms. This has led to multiple users gaining access to the same quantum computers sequentially through cloud-based interfaces. However, quantum computers today are susceptible to noise, which causes computational errors. Compounded with widespread user access, this susceptibility opens avenues for side-channel threats within quantum computing systems, where malicious users may exploit these vulnerabilities to intercept and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information. Given the wide-ranging applicability of quantum computing across various domains, the ramifications of confidential information leakage can be detrimental. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of existing side-channel attack vectors targeting quantum computing systems, along with an analysis of their implications aiming to facilitate the development of secure and accessible quantum computing systems.},

  abstract={This work contains the analysis of results received after running synthesized quantum circuits for training perceptron neural networks. The training is performed by creating a Grover’s algorithm with a custom oracle function. The concept of synthesizing quantum circuits was showcased in the process of generating training circuits for three perceptron topologies, which were designed to test the accuracy of the synthesis process. The test circuits serve to prove that the proposed synthesis approach could be scaled to utilize more complex quantum computing systems and to solve more practical tasks. IBM’s 100-qubit cloud quantum simulator was used as the debugging environment. Quantum circuits for described algorithms are generated by the "Naginata" quantum synthesizer, its source code is published and further documented on GitHub along with the code for the provided example algorithms. The article describes the processes behind the algorithm for synthesizing quantum circuits that perform the training process of single-layer perceptrons by finding their weights by filtering all possible input values through a predefined accuracy criterion. Since quantum computing is still in its early development phase, quantum circuits are created mainly by manual placement of logic elements. Implementing quantum algorithms, especially more use-case specific ones, directly on the quantum circuit level could lead to the circuit easily becoming too complex for human comprehension. Quantum Circuit Synthesizer "Naginata" was created to simplify the development and debugging process of quantum algorithms, by adding better clarity to their development process. In our case, better clarity for the development process is achieved by composing functions for commonly used operations performed in the implemented quantum algorithm. The programmer could now implement the quantum algorithm as a set of functions, instead of manually creating a circuit from single logic elements. After this, the synthesizer would handle the task of creating the data for placing logic elements on the circuit. This enables an opportunity of implementing quantum algorithms with higher-level commands. In the scope of this work, parametrically generated generic blocks for frequently used operations such as: the adder, multiplier and digital comparator were created and utilized to form the training circuits. The test results, proved that with the help of the proposed quantum synthesizer, these compositions could be used efficiently as building blocks for implementing quantum algorithms. And by visually comparing sizes of both code and circuit representations of the synthesized circuits, to the code examples used to synthesize these circuits, it is determined that the proposed approach for implementing quantum circuits greatly simplifies the processes of development and debugging a quantum algorithm.},

  abstract={Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this "quantum advantage", a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept.},

  abstract={In quantum-based computing, the communication uses quantum bits rather than digital bits to address the information. This work proposes to employ encrypted communication for sharing the keys called bits in the Quantum framework. Cloud computing is one of the services, which supports both communication and quantum registering. For small to huge computing tasks, providing any software, platform, or infrastructure as a service, pay-n-use technique should be possible in distributed computing. Based on the duration and amount of administration utilization, the payment will be determined. The principle aim of the distributed computing is to create a resource where anybody can get to any help, whatsoever from anyplace. Protection and security are the fundamental dangers and issues of distributed computing. To overcome such problems in distributed computing, multi-tenure and framework sub-contracting method is used. The proposed encoding technique is far speedier and more effective than traditional encryption, for example, DNA-based encryption computing. To protect the information from intruders, better safety efforts are required. This theoretical investigation recommends such a strategy to defend against certain attacks.},

  abstract={With the growing adoption of cloud computing, ensuring data security in cloud environments has become a critical concern for business organizations. Quantum cryptography utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication, as any attempt to eavesdrop will change the quantum states, alerting the parties of the intrusion. This paper proposes a multi-qubit Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) for cloud security. The proposed multi-qubit QKD model for secure cloud data using quantum cryptography involves the use of a quantum key distribution protocol to generate a secure key for encryption and decryption. This protocol involves sending quantum signals through a quantum channel to distribute a secret key between the sender and the receiver. The key is then used for the encryption and decryption of data using the CP-ABE technique. This technique allows the encryption and decryption of data based on attributes rather than an explicit key exchange, making it particularly suitable for cloud environments where data is stored and processed by multiple users with varying levels of access. The positive results from the proposed simulation model suggest the potential of quantum cryptography in securing cloud data.},

Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM’s Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources.},

This expansion will cause substantial challenges in ensuring network security and privacy protection, as well as in addressing the associated issue of inadequate cloud computing resources.

This protocol utilizes quantum communication technology in edge-to-cloud communication of the IoV to transmit sensitive information embedded in quantum state data, thereby ensuring privacy protection. It employs quantum error-correction coding and efficient coding techniques to extract information and recover the carriers. In addition, the protocol utilizes an improved quantum Grover algorithm in the cloud to accelerate the processing speed of quantum data. By addressing security vulnerabilities and improving cloud-computing capabilities, the QEPP can effectively accommodate critical requirements, including precision, timeliness, and robust privacy protection.},

Leveraging the unique properties of quantum circuits, Moirai introduces a customized circuit representation scheme, incorporating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) conversion and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embedding vector feature extraction. Central to Moirai is the use of reinforcement learning, which drives a suite of decision pipelines for device allocation and circuit deployment strategy. We conduct extensive evaluations involving 95 prevalent quantum algorithm circuits across 3∼7 qubits, utilizing 10 IBM quantum physical devices with three types of chip topologies. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances resource allocation efficiency and overall performance, achieving a noteworthy reduction in execution time of over 30% compared to baseline methods. This underscores the effect of Moirai as a practical solution for optimizing quantum cloud services and unlocking the potential of quantum computing technology.},

  abstract={Quantum computing resources are now becoming easily accessible from various cloud providers. Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work.},

  abstract={Security has always been a critical issue in machine learning (ML) applications. Due to the high cost of model training – such as collecting relevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power – model-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important issues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning (QML) model-stealing attack also exists and is even more severe because the traditional encryption method, such as homomorphic encryption can hardly be directly applied to quantum computation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources, the monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones in the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a third-party company can be delegated to a quantum cloud provider as a service to be used by ordinary users. In this case, the QML model is likely to be leaked if the cloud provider is under attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely QuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms, we propose to divide the complete QML model into multiple parts and distribute them to multiple physically isolated quantum cloud providers for execution. As such, even if the adversary in a single provider can obtain a partial model, it does not have sufficient information to retrieve the complete model. Although promising, we observed that an arbitrary model design under distributed settings cannot provide model security. We further developed a reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically optimize the model design under the distributed setting, such that a good trade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental results on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can achieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search under centralized settings while providing the highest security than the baselines.},

  abstract={What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers, just within a decade? But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology is revolutionizing industries all over the world. Due to recent developments in machine learning, new technologies like cloud computing and safe data exchange have evolved. The collecting and processing of training data on centralized systems is required for conventional machine learning methods. New decentralized machine learning algorithms and cloud computing have made ML on-device information learning possible. IoT devices may use cloud computing services to outsource training duties, enabling AI at the network edge. Nevertheless, these scattered edges intelligence systems introduce new problems, such as concerns over user privacy and information security.

Due to its decentralized, accessible, and secure structure, blockchain has developed into a breakthrough invention for the future of numerous sectors' purposes. Additionally, this system has reliable automated scripting execution and immutable information recorders. Recently, as quantum technologies have become more practical, blockchain has begun to face potential threats from quantum computing.

  abstract={Load balancing plays an important role in cloud computing environment. A better load balancing algorithm provides more efficient service and improves cloud computing performance. In this paper, a new dynamic time quantum priority-based algorithm has been proposed which is suitable for load balancing in cloud computing environment. Round Robin is a very simple algorithm in cloud computing environment but the disadvantage of round robin algorithm is long waiting time, long response time and overhead for context switches. In this paper, we have proposed a new dynamic round robin algorithm with execution time slice which is used to determine dynamic time quantum (TQ) for individual service request in every round. Here the priority has been used to calculate the Priority Component (PC) of the process. Our experimental result gives the better performance in term of minimizing average waiting time, total number of context switches and average turnaround time.},

  abstract={The 6G (the sixth generation mobile communication) network is a heterogeneous network, which includes the cloud computing and the fog computing environment. And, the data securities in the 6G Systems may face great challenges. On the one hand, fine-grained data access control in fog and cloud computing environments is essential to the 6G network. On the other hand, quantum computing attacks may cause great security threats for the 6G network. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a lattice-based fine-grained data access control and sharing scheme in fog and cloud computing environments (LB-DACSS) for the 6G network. Firstly, our LB-DACSS scheme can achieve secure data sharing and fine-grained access control in fog and cloud computing environments. Secondly, we apply a lattice encryption algorithm to ensure our LB-DACSS scheme can withstand quantum computing attacks. Thirdly, our LB-DACSS scheme can achieve secure attribute revocation. Fourthly, we bind a unique secret value related to the user's attribute to construct the user's secret key. Finally, both formal security analysis and performance analysis show that our LB-DACSS scheme is efficient and secure.},

  abstract={The classical computer is restricted by Moore's law and other factors into the development bottleneck, quantum computer by virtue of its natural acceleration advantage into the field of vision. Quantum computing can achieve the acceleration effect compared with classical computing in many fields. In the field of integer decomposition, Shor algorithm can be solved in polynomial time, which breaks the security of RSA public key cryptosystem. However, the quantum bits (logn + 2, where n is the integer to be decomposed) required by Shor algorithm are difficult to be realized on today's quantum computers. Therefore, the hybrid quantum algorithm model of "classical + quantum (Grover algorithm)" is tried to realize the decomposition of large integers. In this paper, based on the previous hybrid quantum algorithm model, considering that the continuous accumulation of errors in the circuit of the quantum algorithm will lead to the failure of the algorithm as the depth increases, part of the circuit of the quantum algorithm oracle is optimized to reduce the consumption of the depth, quantum gate and quantum bit in the circuit of the quantum algorithm, so as to make it easier to run on the actual quantum computer. By running the optimized quantum circuit on the back end of the simulator of IBM Q quantum cloud platform, and trying to add thermal relaxation and depolarization noises to the circuit, the influence of different noises on the circuit under different iterations was explored.},

This lag in response time could prove vital while dealing with critical patients like those presenting with cardiac arrest or myocardial infarction and other quality of service (QoS), thus proving the inefficacy of cloud computing in meeting such intense demand. In order to avoid such delay, it necessitates introduction of a novel technology such as Fog computing.

Quantum computers have been used successfully in the solution of non-deterministic polynomial-time problems for a while. Using quantum algorithms to find ways to speed up the computing of some hard problems reveals a concept called quantum supremacy. With the improvement of quantum computers and a decrease in error rates, companies that develop quantum computers have offered cloud-based platforms to make their computers publicly available and to be programmed via the web. The cloud programming approach likewise influenced the programming of quantum computers.

  abstract={The purpose of this project is to design and implement a framework that employs unique authentication method that relies on third party identification which is required to accurately identify and authenticate legitimate user in order to reduce the risk of disclosing confidential data to unauthorized party in Mobile Cloud Computing, MCC. Cloud computing is a service provided for user to store and process their data online instead of local device. Mobile Cloud computing which is an extension of the cloud computing service allows user to remotely access their data and services that are being uploaded to the cloud beforehand in any place and any time as long as they have internet connection in their personal mobile device. Throughout the period of the mobile cloud computing era, the security has always been a concern and post as a formidable challenge even for experienced security specialist. Moreover, encryption method such as RSA and Diffie Hellman cryptosystem proven to be useless against the attacks launched by quantum computer. Hence, Homomorphic Signature scheme is introduced along with the Identity Management (IDM) server into the mobile cloud computing in order to address this issue by applying implicit authentication method to differentiate between the genuine and non-genuine user which allows system to authenticate the clients accurately. The details of the framework will be further explained later in this paper, where the user will be authenticated with IDM as medium and no password is used throughout the authentication process, allowing the client to be safely authenticated at the end of the process.},

  abstract={Edge computing is a computing framework that offers fewer computing resources compared to cloud computing but brings enterprise applications closer to data sources like Internet of Things (IoT) devices or local edge servers. This proximity to data sources brings significant business benefits such as faster insights, improved response time, and better bandwidth availability. Consequently, edge computing technologies have witnessed widespread adoption. Edge computing faces significant security challenges due to factors like limited cost, volume, and power consumption, as well as the potential risk of quantum computers breaking conventional cryptographic systems. Limitation of computing power in edge computing nodes further complicates the system architecture to achieve secure data transmission. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight trusted inference mechanism specifically designed for edge computing workloads. The primary objective of this mechanism is to establish a balance between security and bandwidth by incorporating a post-quantum encryption to the edge computing devices. This is achieved through sharing convolution and encryption hardware at the edge while encrypting and transmitting intermediate results of inference computations to the cloud, thereby minimizing resource usage and transmission bandwidth requirements. The FPGA platform is utilized to implement a template hardware design, which demonstrated comparable resource consumption to the stateof-art work. Simulation results indicate that our mechanism achieves a 45.3% reduction in LUTs and a 55.5% reduction in DFFs within the hardware, while introducing only a marginal software slowdown of 0.39%.},

  abstract={Quantum computing has become widely available to researchers via cloud-hosted devices with different technologies using a multitude of software development frameworks. The vertical stack behind such solutions typically features quantum language abstraction and high-level translation frameworks that tend to be open source, down to pulse-level programming. However, the lower-level mapping to the control electronics, such as controls for laser and microwave pulse generators, remains closed source for contemporary commercial cloud-hosted quantum devices. One exception is the ARTIQ (Advanced Real-Time Infrastructure for Quantum physics) open-source library for trapped-ion control electronics. This stack has been complemented by the Duke ARTIQ Extensions (DAX) to provide modularity and better abstraction. It, however, remains disconnected from the wealth of features provided by popular quantum computing languages. This paper contributes QisDAX, a bridge between Qiskit and DAX that fills this gap. QisDAX provides interfaces for Python programs written using IBM's Qiskit and transpiles them to the DAX abstraction. This allows users to generically interface to the ARTIQ control systems accessing trapped-ion quantum devices. Consequently, the algorithms expressed in Qiskit become available to an open-source quantum software stack. This provides the first open-source, end-to-end, full-stack pipeline for remote submission of quantum programs for trapped-ion quantum systems in a non-commercial setting.},

Using 3-qubit and 5-qubit models, we demonstrated its efficacy on quantum simulators and IBM quantum hardware. Remarkably, we achieved 100% error correction accuracy on simulators and significant success rates on IBM hardware: 68.95% for error correction and 86.04% for error detection in 5-qubit systems. However, the Quantum Repetition Code (QRC) showed limitations in handling multiple-qubit errors in 5-qubit systems.

  abstract={Truly random integers, which are the absolute requirement for this type of cryptography, are necessary for data security. Conventional PRNGs is deterministically which makes them predicted. This type of weakness is present in them. Unlike conventional algorithms, QRNG uses something very fundamental, quantum physics. It has allowed for a breakthrough in using random numbers that are unpredictable. The main goal of the project to design a system including the QRNG (quantum random number generator) and cloud platform developed by IBM. The system produces robust and ideal output for cryptography while being both effective and efficient. We will conduct detailed and effective tuning and testing so as to increase output. Outputs of this project are a QRNG system built on the cloud that can be connected with cryptographic applications, certified sequence, and informational materials of the organization. With this research of QRNGs synchronized with the IBM cloud platform, we make cryptographic security stronger by using the quantum mechanical method to create truly random numbers. Moreover, QRNGs contribute to the cryptographic applications which are intended to be incredibly secure and of high dependability by providing random numbers to enter the realm of crypto-with very little human participation. Basically, the cloud-based architecture enable systems to scale and possible failure resilience via migrating the workload or storing the data online. Quantum improvements will speed up the process of replacing the currently accepted cryptographic paradigm with something opening new ways of digital communication. This research is about quantum physics, cloud computing, and cryptography, bringing together how these concepts operate, as a result, of the unexpected and secure cryptographic applications.},

In order to meet the requirements of multiclient accessing or computing encrypted cloud data, all clients with limited quantum ability outsource the key generation to a trusted key center and upload their encrypted data to the data center. Considering the feasibility of physical implementation, all quantum gates in the circuit are replaced with the combination of π/8 rotation operator set {Rz(π/4), Ry(π/4), CRz(π/4), CRy(π/4), CCRz(π/4), CCRy(π/4)}. In addition, the data center is only allowed to perform one π/8 rotation operator each time, but does not know the structure of the circuit (i.e., quantum computation), soit can guarantee the blindness of computation. Then, through combining this multi-client FBQC model and Grover searching algorithm, we continue to propose a quantum searchable encryption scheme for cloud data. It solves the problem of multi-client access mode under searchable encryption in the cloud environment, and has the ability to resist against some quantum attacks. To better demonstrate our scheme, an example of our scheme to search on encrypted 2-qubit state is given in detail. Furthermore, the security of our scheme is analysed from two aspects: external attacks and internal attacks, and the result indicates that it can resist against such kinds of attacks and also guarantee the blindness of data and computation.},

  abstract={With the drive to create a decentralized digital economy, Web 3.0 has become a cornerstone of digital transformation, developed on the basis of computing power networks, distributed data storage, and blockchain. With the rapid realization of quantum devices, Web 3.0 is being developed in parallel with the deployment of quantum cloud computing and quantum Internet. In this regard, quantum computing first disrupts the original cryptographic systems that protect data security while reshaping modern cryptography with the advantages of quantum computing and communication. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce a quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 framework that provides information-theoretic security for decentralized data transferring and payment transactions. First, we present the framework of quantum blockchain-driven Web 3.0 with futureproof security during the transmission of data and transaction information. Next, we discuss the potential applications and challenges of implementing quantum blockchain in Web 3.0. Finally, we describe a use case for quantum non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and propose a quantum deep learning-based optimal auction for NFT trading to maximize the achievable revenue for sufficient liquidity in Web 3.0. In this way, the proposed framework can achieve proven security and sustainability for the next-generation decentralized digital society.},

  abstract={Simulating quantum field theories on a quantum computer is one of the most exciting fundamental physics applications of quantum information science. Dynamical time evolution of quantum fields is a challenge that is beyond the capabilities of classical computing, but it can teach us important lessons about the fundamental fabric of space and time. Whether we may answer scientific questions of interest using near-term quantum computing hardware is an open question that requires a detailed simulation study of quantum noise. Here we present a large scale simulation study powered by a multi-node implementation of qsim using the Google Cloud Platform. We additionally employ newly-developed GPU capabilities in qsim and show how Tensor Processing Units — Application-specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) specialized for Machine Learning — may be used to dramatically speed up the simulation of large quantum circuits. We demonstrate the use of high performance cloud computing for simulating ℤ2 quantum field theories on system sizes up to 36 qubits. We find this lattice size is not able to simulate our problem and observable combination with sufficient accuracy, implying more challenging observables of interest for this theory are likely beyond the reach of classical computation using exact circuit simulation.},

  abstract={As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, efficient quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis and optimization of job / resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing.This paper proposes optimized adaptive job scheduling to the quantum cloud taking note of primary characteristics such as queuing times and fidelity trends across machines, as well as other characteristics such as quality of service guarantees and machine calibration constraints. Key components of the proposal include a) a prediction model which predicts fidelity trends across machine based on compiled circuit features such as circuit depth and different forms of errors, as well as b) queuing time prediction for each machine based on execution time estimations.Overall, this proposal is evaluated on simulated IBM machines across a diverse set of quantum applications and system loading scenarios, and is able to reduce wait times by over 3x and improve fidelity by over 40% on specific usecases, when compared to traditional job schedulers.},

  abstract={The integration of Quantum Computers (QC) within High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments holds significant promise for solving real-world problems by leveraging the strengths of both computational paradigms. However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services. This work lay the foundation for advancing quantum computing accessibility and usability in hybrid HPC-QC infrastructures.},

Enterprises such as IBM, Google, and Microsoft have launched or will launch shortly cloud quantum computing services, which will accelerate forward the development of the field even further. It is, therefore, necessary to prepare the RAMS community to harness the advantages that quantum computing may offer to our discipline. In this paper, we present a proposed application for efficient probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks using gate-based quantum computing and a quantum algorithm called Amplitude Amplification. The proposed methodology is exemplified on a non-trivial Bayesian network, composed of nodes representing discrete probability distributions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use Bayesian networks in combination with Amplitude Amplification for the risk and reliability assessment context. The results indicate that the usage of quantum computing can effectively increase the efficiency of the sampling process, decreasing the number of samples required to obtain estimates of similar quality when compared to a traditional Monte Carlo sampling approach.},

  abstract={In recent times, there has been a considerable increase in Cloud-Based applications and infrastructure. This has led to quicker innovations, agile businesses, availability of new services over the internet, improved collaboration, and better security. With the growth of new technologies like blockchain, quantum computing, mobility-focused applications, and edge computing, there has been an increased interest in adopting cloud services. In this paper, we highlight the different sustainability metrics and benefits while migrating workloads from the on-prem data center to the public clouds. Also, the clouds are elastic, scalable, cost-efficient, robust, and overall a better alternative to host the client applications and services. We present how the major Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) are continuously working on improving their infrastructure for a more energy efficient cloud. But with so many factors like the cost of cloud services, the location of the data center to name a few, it becomes quite a tedious task for the clients to select a cloud service provider when moving from their on-premise data center(s). Hence, we also briefly propose our solution that we are currently working on. The final goal is to have a cross-platform advisory that based on a wide-range of client-based inputs and a rich repository of current energy efficient clouds and their sustainability metrics, aims to provide them a detailed recommendation about their preferred cloud service provider. In case the client does not provide any such preference, the advisory should also recommend an ideal cloud service provider for their particular workload. This suggested action will be able to fulfill the client's constraints as well as provide them an energy efficient cloud along with a sustainability score. This score is indicative of how much improvement in the energy consumed and carbon footprint can be achieved through this migration to the suggested cloud.},

  abstract={Lattice-based encryption is a promising public key cryptography to resist quantum computing attacks. Simultaneously, due to the need for fine-grained access control in cloud environments, it is crucial to do the research on attribute-based encryption (ABE). However, researches on ABE algorithm have some problems such as not having mechanisms secure enough to defend against quantum computing attacks with high decryption accuracy, having vulnerabilities to collusion attacks and lacking of attribute revocation mechanism. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a new data encryption scheme with fine-grained access control based on the shortest vector problem in the cloud computing environment (DES-SVP). We formally prove that our DES-SVP scheme can resist quantum computing attacks and can resist collusion attacks between users. We reduce our DES-SVP scheme to the problem of finding a short vector in a lattice so that our scheme can withstand quantum computing attacks. Finally, the performance analysis shows that our DES-SVP scheme can achieve efficient results comparing with other related works.},

Nowadays, quantum computers are usually offered in the cloud, under a pay-per-use model, leading to the adoption of the service-oriented good practices that dominate the cloud today. However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway—an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time.

  abstract={Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are widely used for quantum computing (QC) from quantum cloud providers. Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7% (up to 36.7%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines.},

  pages={990-1000},
  abstract={Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is ~ 39% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios.},

As a solution, IBM Quantum (IBMQ) systems developed by IBM are accessed via the cloud. Although there are high qubit quantum backends currently offered for a fee, 5 and 7 qubit backends are publicly free. In this study, publicly free quantum backends in the IBM quantum experience environment are discussed. The study includes a comparative explanation of the factors affecting the performance of quantum computers. Quantum circuits were created in the IBM Composer environment and then run on the appropriate backend. Quantum circuits of 4mod5, which finds whether a 4-bit number is divisible by 5, 1-bitadder that performs 1-bit addition with the carry bit, and gray code, which finds the gray code equivalent of the binary number, were created. The created circuits were run on 8 different IBMQ backends and the results were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that while the simplicity of the gates used increases the performance rates, there may be different backends that operate each quantum circuit more accurately. It is hoped that the study will be a guide for researchers working on applied quantum computing.},

  abstract={Cloud storage provides an efficient and convenient way to manage data, but it also poses significant challenges to data security. The central issue with cloud storage is to ensure the ability of the data owner to control and manage the outsourced data. The password-protected secret sharing (PPSS) integrates password authentication and secret sharing to offer a fresh approach to secure private data. Users can share the risk of device corruption with a well-designed PPSS scheme and manage outsourced data with only human-memorizable passwords. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing PPSS schemes can resist security threats in the post-quantum era, and there is an urgent need to design quantum-resistant solutions. However, post-quantum cryptography varies significantly from traditional cryptography, and it is challenging to design a quantum-resistant password-protected secret-sharing scheme for cloud storage. In this work, we take the first substantial step towards this challenge by proposing QPause, a quantum-resistant password-protected data outsourcing scheme for cloud storage. We first design a basic lattice-based PPSS secure against semi-honest adversaries with a secure channel. On this foundation, we propose a quantum-resistant round-optimal password-protected data outsourcing scheme against strong adversaries. In addition, we formally prove that our scheme is secure and robust under various attacks against adversaries with quantum computing capabilities. The comparison results show that our new scheme outperforms its foremost counterparts.},

This paper shows the effect of using quantum entanglement phenomena upon the classical cloud network, particularly using an entanglement theory to decrease the enlarged signaling cost delay that the traditional cloud network faces. Through modeling the latency of both paradigms, this paper promises a delay reduction when adapting a quantum method into the mobile cloud networks. This paper also models the power consumption (PC) and energy efficiency of the traditional and quantum-based cloud networks.

  abstract={Quantum network simulation is an essential step towards developing applications for quantum networks and determining minimal requirements for the network hardware. As it is with classical networking, a simulation ecosystem allows for application development, standardization, and overall community building. Currently, there is limited traction towards building a quantum networking community—there are limited open-source platforms, challenging frameworks with steep learning curves, and strong requirements of software engineering skills. Our Quantum Network Development Kit (QNDK) project aims to solve these issues. It includes a graphical user interface to easily develop and run quantum network simulations with very little code. It integrates various quantum network simulation engines and provides a single interface to them, allowing users to use the features from any of them. Further, it deploys simulation execution in a cloud environment, offloading strong computing requirements to a high-performance computing system. In this paper, we detail the core features of the QNDK and outline the development roadmap to enabling virtual quantum testbeds.},

To strengthen smart meter data encryption through optimized integration of a cloud-based quantum random number generator (QRNG) service. QRNGs leverage intrinsic quantum properties to produce true randomness for cryptographic keys. An architecture is presented utilizing a QRNG service on the IBM quantum computing platform. Quantum entropy is remotely sampled and delivered on-demand via APIs to generate quantum random AES encryption keys for smart meter communications. Homomorphic encryption secures credential transmission. Compared to mathematical pseudorandom number generators, the quantum origin provides stronger security against brute force attacks and future quantum computing decryption. Tailoring QRNG generation and integration focuses on the performance, cost, and deployment constraints of grid-wide encryption hardening.

  abstract={Security and privacy are issues that cannot be ignored when collecting and processing medical data in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The blockchain technology is a decentralized ledger system that has diverse application scenarios in the medical field. The blockchain technology relies on traditional cryptography to ensure data integrity and verifiability, but the creation of quantum computing has made it possible to break traditional encryption and signature methods. Therefore, quantum blockchain can provide a higher level of security for handling medical data. This article innovatively designs a new medical data processing system based on quantum blockchain (QB-IMD). In QB-IMD, a quantum blockchain structure and a novel electronic medical record algorithm (QEMR) are proposed to ensure that the processed data is legitimate and tamper-proof. QEMR combines quantum signature and quantum identity authentication to avoid the potential security risks of digital signatures. In addition, through delegated computing by quantum cloud, medical diagnostic data can be computed without leaking to quantum cloud servers, thus protecting user privacy. Through mathematical proof, theoretical analysis, and simulation, it is demonstrated that our scheme can resist six attacks and is feasible to protect user privacy.},

  abstract={Fingerprinting is one of the most commonly used techniques for indoor localization due to their high accuracy in the presence of the wireless channel noise. Nonetheless, they require significant storage overhead and running time. This becomes even more important when scaling such systems to a worldwide scale.Quantum computing can speedup computation of intractable problems that are hard to solve on the traditional classical computers. In this paper, we propose a realistic quantum fingerprint based algorithm that builds on quantum computing concepts to scale. In particular, the proposed fingerprinting algorithm can provide exponential enhancement in both space and running time over the classical fingerprinting techniques. We explain the details of the quantum fingerprint construction, how to encode the fingerprint signal strength vectors in quantum states, and how to calculate the quantum similarity between the online signal strength measurement and the offline ones. In addition, we study the different practical implementation and deployment issues on IBM quantum computing cloud machines.Implementation and evaluation of our algorithm in a real testbed using quantum machines confirms its ability to correctly obtain the estimated location with an exponential enhancement in both time and space compared to the traditional classical fingerprinting techniques. This highlights the promise of our algorithm to scale fingerprinting localization to be used globally.},

  abstract={Task scheduling is one of the crucial agendas in cloud computing technology. The system consists of various tasks namely termed cloudlets which need to be fed among various processing units for its execution. However, the algorithm that has been used to schedule tasks among various processing units should provide the optimum solution to a given problem. This research realizes the power of quantum computation specifically quantum annealing to provide the optimum solution to schedule the tasks among various processing units under the given constraints. Quantum Annealing is used for combinatorial optimization problems and as task scheduling is also one of such problems, it can be done in the quantum environment for optimal results. The Hybrid Solver provided by the D-Wave Quantum Computer has been used to solve the given problem.Leveraging the D-Wave Quantum Annealer, we analyze various scheduling scenarios and evaluate the performance in terms of makespan and throughput. Our findings reveal substantial improvements in scheduling efficiency compared to Partical Swarm Optimization scheduling. Specifically, we observed a notable reduction in makespan by up to 70% across diverse workload scenarios. Moreover, there was not much difference in throughput provided by both algorithms. The task scheduling among various processing units using quantum annealing has provided significant differences in makespan. Thus, using an annealing technique to schedule the tasks in cloud computing would significantly enhance in load balancing and efficient use of resources.},

  abstract={To cope with the unauthorized access to the cloud treasure of resources and services, several cloud service providers implement the API-based access control approach and grant thus a full authentication of any client application. Once called, each cloud API (Application Programming Interface) is required to authenticate through a secret access key, commonly termed API key. A plethora of security risks is associated with these keys whether during their generation, storage, or utilization. The hardware secure element-based proposal aims for an end-to-end security between a cloud service provider and a client application. To ensure a reliable and secure API key exchange, the concerned entities rely on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). As soon as an adversary acquires an unbounded computing power, it would be easy to intercept the keys and then unlock the gate behind the valuables over the cloud. In this paper, we propose a revised scheme that discards the PKI and installs a quantum mechanism to mutually authenticate the secure element and the cloud service provider by establishing a set of shared keys. A pioneering absolute security of the presented approach is warranted by the principles of quantum physics. To analyze the security of the quantum technology, we establish a formal verification based on PRISM model checking tool. We outstandingly focus on satisfying two prominent properties: (i) both the parties engaged in the quantum protocol are able to detect any disallowed eavesdropping and (ii) the valid amount of information caught by an adversary on the installed key must be negligible.},

  abstract={Quantum computing has entered a fast development track since Shor's algorithm was proposed in 1994. Multi-cloud services of quantum computing farms are currently available. One of which, IBM quantum computing, presented a road map showing their Kookaburra system with over 4158 qubits that will be available in 2025. For the standardization of Post-Quantum Cryptography or PQC, the National Institute of Standards and Technology or NIST recently announced the first candidates for standardization with one algorithm for key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), Kyber, and three algorithms for digital signatures. NIST has also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June 1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol would take a predictably long time. However, 'steal now, crack later’ tactic requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad for data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10%.},

  abstract={Cloud services will have a high priority in IT and parts of digitisation in the following years. Furthermore, other areas such as medicine, agriculture, Industry 4.0 use cloud services for collecting, processing, and primarily storing data and combine this with smart IoT devices. In addition to high availability and ensuring efficiency without downtime, data security is the most important in those cloud environments. Therefore, enabling traffic encryption between sensors and cloud computing to achieve the authentication and integrity of saved data is expected. And established cryptographic algorithms, like the symmetric scheme or the asymmetric Public-Key technique Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), guaranteed the security of the data in the pre-quantum computer age. However, some cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable because of emerging quantum computing and are defined as potentially broken. It is, therefore, desirable to explore the use of post-quantum cryptography to ensure data security. This paper shows an approach to keep long-term data quantum-safe with a block cipher suite.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of the computing paradigm, cloud computing becomes the most notable one that offers convenient and on-demand services from a shared pool of configurable computing resources. However, the application of quantum computers in clouds would be realized from the recent breakthrough results of quantum computers. In the near future, existing conventional hardness-based authentication schemes will be confronted with quantum attackers. Lattice-based authentication scheme resolves this tension. Albeit, existing lattice-based schemes, users and cloud servers are always worried about the communication privacy against misbehaved private key generator referred to as mPKG since PKG potentially has the power to generate the secret key for any given identity. In this paper, we proposed a secure authentication scheme for cloud storage that thwarts the misbehaved PKG. We integrate the identity-based encryption (IBE) scheme with the lattice-based signature, which is the variant of existing IBE-based authentication schemes and post-quantum secure. Additionally, we integrate identity certifying authority (ICA) with PKG to ensure security against misbehaved PKG. Our comprehensive security proof demonstrates that the proposed scheme provides stronger security guarantees against misbehaved PKG and ICA.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is shaping the world of every economy and client. By 2023, clients, companies, and governments will be able to install a total of 40 billion IoT devices worldwide. The 2021's challenges simply confirmed the necessity to secure all four elements of the IoT Model: Sensors, Networks, Cloud, and Applications. Therefore, it is important to be pragmatic regarding the extreme threats and high worth of attacks on secrecy in IoT systems. Although the concept of convergence of IoT and Quantum Computing is not a standby topic, it had been mentioned in several works of literature and coated by many researchers, however, nothing is getting ready for sensible applications thus far. Quantum Computing is not prepared nevertheless, it is so far from preparation on a billboard scale. Quantum computing resolves most of the issues in IoT however it occurs yet below the analysis phase and can take over a couple of years to induce in public obtainable use. During this research, the author will start through a broad introduction to the internet of things and Quantum Computing and carry on with issues that can be featured throughout the convergence of Quantum Computing and IoT. To solve these integration issues in terms of cryptography this research will also provide the answer. At long last, this research will call attention to the hybrid of both fields to existing IoT network design.},

The online attackers disrupt the use of the on-demand services provided by the cloud service providers for their clients. It is distributed in nature for resource sharing over the Internet. Thus, security has become the main agenda for cloud computing usage by cloud customers. As a result, the financial growth of cloud-based organizations is increasing gradually. The critical situation of cloud security is identifying the types of attacks and deciding how to defend such attacks to protect the cloud data from attackers. Numerous methodologies are reviewed to determine the robust security mechanisms for cloud security to protect against DoS or DDoS attacks (by malware attacks, MITM attacks, or other medium attacks). The ML concept has incorporated algorithm conceptions like deep neural networks and quantum neural networks to enhance prediction and protection accuracy. These proposed models not only help to reduce the attack level up to $100 \%$ but also increase the trust of cloud users with financial growth to cloud service providers (CSPs).},

  abstract={Cloud computing technologies rely on powerful storage services and computing capabilities to maintain massive data for users. Since many cloud storage data probably contain sensitive privacy information, they are typically encrypted before outsourcing, which simultaneously limits the availability due to the difficulty of encrypted data retrieval. Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) contributes to searching target encrypted data with keywords. However, majority of existing PEKS mechanisms require to manage certificates in the public key infrastructure (PKI), they are also vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum-computing devices in the near future. In this article, we devise a biometric identity-based multi-keyword search (BIB-MKS) mechanism from lattices over encrypted outsourced data, which inherently resists quantum-computing attacks. Each user in BIB-MKS is identified with her/his biometric information, which could be envisioned as the public key, thereby avoiding complex certificate managements. Particularly, BIB-MKS enables a data owner to produce an index associated with a biometric identity $BID^{\prime }$BID', such that a user with a biometric identity $BID$BID issues multiple keywords in a single search query and retrieves corresponding encrypted data, if and only if $BID$BID and $BID^{\prime }$BID' are within a certain distance of each other as judged by some metric. BIB-MKS narrows down the search scope, and improves users search experience significantly. We define the formal security model of BIB-MKS, and prove the security of BIB-MKS under this model. The performance evaluation demonstrates that BIB-MKS is practical for post-quantum secure cloud storage systems.},

  abstract={With the advent of the intelligent and digital era, intelligent urban rail transit systems have been a research focus. As the core part of intelligent urban rail transit systems, smart trains are empowered by various intelligent applications. While improving system performance and reducing system risk, intelligent applications demand a large amount of computing power. However, it is challenging to provide simultaneously all intelligent applications for smart trains due to limited on-board computing resources. In this article, we design a train-edge-cloud (TEC) collaborative computing framework for train intelligent computing tasks. We aim to develop a TEC-based collaborative computing scheme to minimize the task processing delay with edge computing resource constraints. Considering the unique environment of smart train systems, we design a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to realize collaborative computing optimization. We design a novel risk function in the system by jointly considering the computing load of edge intelligence (EI) servers and the characteristics of the urban rail transit systems. Moreover, we optimize the proposed risk-sensitive RL algorithm by using quantum representation and functions to accelerate its convergence speed. We design the TEC-based collaborative computing framework and design the quantum-inspired risk-sensitive RL algorithm to formulate the strategies for task scheduling. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the algorithm adopted in this article can significantly reduce the task processing delay while satisfying EI servers' computing resource constraints. The quantum-inspired-optimized risk-sensitive RL model dramatically improves the model convergence speed.},

Recently, Qiskit is globally very popular for quantum simulations because it provide us the opportunity to simulate quantum logic circuit on classical computer as well as real quantum computers owned by IBM. As per our best knowledge, there is no any proposal published for quantum circuit by anyone for BB84 QKD. We performed experimentation on local as well as cloud simulators: 1) The "qasm_simulator" was used as local machine simulator, and 2) The "ibmqx2" simulator was used as IBM cloud quantum simulator. The outcome of local as well as IBM simulator with and without an eavesdropper, between the two parties involved in key exchange were recorded and presented in the results section.},

  abstract={The advent of quantum computers poses a serious challenge to the security of cloud infrastructures and services, as they can potentially break the existing public-key cryptosystems, such as Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Even though the gap between today's quantum computers and the threats they pose to current public-key cryptography is large, the cloud landscape should act proactively and initiate the transition to the post-quantum era as early as possible. To comply with that, the U.S. government issued a National Security Memorandum in May 2022 that mandated federal agencies to migrate to post-quantum cryptosystems (PQC) by 2035. To ensure the long-term security of cloud computing, it is imperative to develop and deploy PQC resistant to quantum attacks. A promising class of post-quantum cryptosystems is based on lattice problems, which require polynomial arithmetic. In this paper, we propose a scalable number-theoretic transform (NTT) architecture that significantly enhances the performance of polynomial multiplication. Our proposed design exploits multilevels of parallelism to accelerate the NTT computation on reconfigurable hardware. We use the high-level synthesis (HLS) method to implement our design, which allows us to describe the NTT algorithm in a high-level language and automatically generate optimized hardware code. HLS facilitates rapid prototyping and enables us to explore different design spaces and trade-offs on the hardware platforms. Our experimental results show that our design achieves 11× speedup compared to the state-of-the-art requiring only 14 clock cycles for an NTT computation over a polynomial of degree 256. To demonstrate the applicability of our design, we also present a coprocessor architecture for Kyber that utilizes our scalable NTT core.},

  abstract={In the last few years the threat of quantum computers has become bigger and bigger. The fast computing of the quantum computers puts everything in danger that relies on classical cryptographic algorithms. The question of when a large-scale quantum computer will be built cannot be exactly answered yet. According to the Cloud Security Alliance at around 2030 the power of quantum computers will increase so that the risk for exposure of traditionally encrypted data will be very high. PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) relies on asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and is widely used in many fields. So it is important that it will be completely safe. The way to provide that is to change traditional cryptographic algorithms to post-quantum cryptography algorithms or hybrid solutions. To this, we review in this paper the basics of classical PKI and quantum cryptography methods and the threat of quantum computing for PKI. We present quantum-safe solutions already in use and recommend new, well-performing solutions for a quantum-resistant PKI by comparison.},

  abstract={The effectiveness and dependability of real-time incident detection models directly impact the safety and operational conditions of the affected traffic routes. Recent advancements in cloud-based quantum computing infrastructure and developments in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices have ushered in a new era of quantum-enhanced algorithms that can be utilized to enhance the accuracy of real-time incident detection. In this study, a combination of classical and quantum machine learning (ML) models is developed to identify incidents using connected vehicle (CV) data. The performance of the hybrid classical-quantum machine learning model in incident detection is compared to baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data from a microsimulation tool that simulates different incident scenarios. Results show that a hybrid neural network with a 4-qubit quantum layer outperforms all other baseline models considered in this study, even when training data is scarce. Three datasets made are DS-1 with enough training data, DS-2, and DS-3 without enough training data. The hybrid approach produces recall rates of 98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and DS-3, the hybrid model outperforms the classical models on average by 1.9% and 7.8%, respectively, for F2-score, a metric for the model’s ability to correctly recognize occurrences. These results indicate that in realistic scenarios with limited connected vehicles at certain times on specific roadways, the hybrid ML model performs better than classical models. As quantum computing infrastructure continues to improve, quantum ML models could offer a promising alternative for ML applications related to connected vehicles, especially when the available data is insufficient.},

  volume={11},

  pages={2983-2992},
  abstract={Identity-based encryption with equality test (IBEET) provides a feasible way for cloud server partitioning or searching on ciphertexts in the cloud. In that case, the server can judge if two different ciphertexts encrypt the same plaintexts or not. In response to threats posed by quantum computers, lattice-based IBEET schemes have been proposed to make cloud service post-quantum secure. However, those schemes are inefficient and can hardly meet the needs of resource-constrained devices. In this article, an efficient post-quantum IBEET scheme is introduced, which achieves testability by embedding the hash value of plaintext into testing trapdoor instead of encrypting it directly and doubling the size of ciphertext. We also prove that, with the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem assumption, the new scheme is one-way secure against selective identity and chosen ciphertext attacks (OW-sID-CCA) in quantum secure model. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of the new construction and demonstrate its efficiency by showing that it only costs about half storage comparing with other lattice-based IBEET schemes. The execution time of encryption and decryption phrases in the new scheme reduce by 50%, while the computational cost in test algorithm keeps the same. Therefore, the new proposed IBEET is much more practical for working in post-quantum cloud computing scenarios.},

  abstract={Leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, quantum computing become a rapidly evolving research field that solves certain types of problems exponentially faster than classical computers. In quantum computing quantum bits (qubits) can represent multiple states simultaneously using superposition and entanglement. Any disturbance or tampering of information on quantum bits will be easily detectable by the rules of quantum mechanics. This is an essential property and can be utilized in quantum communication. In free space communication, photon polarization and quantum key distribution (QKD) secure the information. However, noise, such as channel and circuit noise, also disturbs flawless communication. This research thoroughly studies a single photon-based protocol, BB84 in its ideal state and injected with noises. The objective of the paper is to induce parametrized noise to observe the effect in various cloud platforms with three different simulators, IBM QASM, CDAC QSim, and AWS Braket. Next, it presents a comprehensive study of the simulation of parametrized noise, bit flip, with the detailed setup and characteristics of these simulators.},

  abstract={With meteoric advancement in quantum computing, the traditional data integrity verifying schemes are no longer safe for cloud data storage. A large number of the current techniques are dependent on expensive Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). They cost computationally and communicationally heavy for verification which do not stand with the advantages when quantum computing techniques are applied. Hence, a quantum safe and efficient integrity verification protocol is a research hotspot. Lattice-based signature constructions involve matrix-matrix or matrix vector multiplications making computation competent, simple and resistant to quantum computer attacks. Study in this paper uses Bloom Filter which offers high efficiency in query and search operations. Further, we propose an Identity-Based Integrity Verification (IBIV) protocol for cloud storage from Lattice and Bloom filter.

But due to security issues like lack of confidentiality, malicious insiders, it has not gained wide spread acceptance to store sensitive information. Researchers have proposed proxy re-encryption schemes for secure data sharing through cloud. Due to advancement of computing technologies and advent of quantum computing algorithms, security of existing schemes can be compromised within seconds. Hence there is a need for designing security schemes which can be quantum computing resistant. In this paper, a secure file sharing scheme through cloud storage using proxy re-encryption technique has been proposed. The proposed scheme is proven to be chosen ciphertext secure(CCA) under hardness of ring-LWE, Search problem using random oracle model. The proposed scheme outperforms the existing CCA secure schemes in-terms of re-encryption time and decryption time for encrypted files which results in an efficient file sharing scheme through cloud storage.},

  pages={660-666},
  abstract={Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a powerful cryptographic technology used in cloud computing and data security. It allows data owners to control access to encrypted data based on specific characteristics rather than individual user IDs. This makes sure that only systems that satisfy certain requirements or people, who are allowed may decode and view the data. Because of its dynamic and adaptable approach to access management, ABE is a great fit for situations with complex and dynamic access requirements. In response to the threat posed by Quantum Computing, this research study focused on developing Post-Quantum ABE schemes that maintain security while also addressing attributes like verifiability, user privacy, and revocability. A novel ABE system founded on rank metric codes has been proposed. The proposed approach is built on low rank parity check codes with a robust resistance against diverse forms of attacks with a compact key size and rapid execution time, demonstrating notable efficiency when compared to other cryptographic systems. This represents a substantial stride forward in enhancing Cloud Computing in the era of Quantum Computing.},

  abstract={Benefiting from cloud computing, today's early-stage quantum computers can be remotely accessed via the cloud services, known as Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS). However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the sub circuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for Preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML.},

  abstract={Real-time computers of the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era undergo the undesirable coupling among qubits known as crosstalk. The negative effects of crosstalk errors can lead to degradation in the performance of various quantum circuits. In this paper, we present four crosstalk models that negatively affect the outcome of Grover’s search algorithm, Simon’s algorithm and the performance of the quantum teleportation protocol. The crosstalk models presented in this work are used as malicious circuits running alongside the victim circuits of the said quantum algorithms and protocol. This is possible in the shared cloud quantum computing environment which is right now offered by some of the industries. This work demonstrates the formation of some of the possible patterns as parts of the malicious circuits and their repetitions to inject crosstalk errors in the victim circuits. The analysis of the affected outputs for each pattern along with the corresponding diagrammatic representation is also done in this article along with the discussion on the degraded results for the used victim circuits other than the state-of-the-art works for the available ones. Moreover, this work highlights the need for proper counter-measures in order to detect and eliminate the malicious patterns that can harm the performance of a quantum circuit.},

  pages={125-134},
  abstract={Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently. Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.},

  abstract={In this paper, we discuss how certain radio access network optimization problems can be modelled using the concept of constraint satisfaction problems in artificial intelligence, and solved at scale using a quantum computer. As a case study, we discuss root sequence index (RSI) assignment problem — an important LTE/NR physical random access channel configuration related automation use-case. We formulate RSI assignment as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem constructed using data ingested from a commercial mobile network, and solve it using a cloud-based commercially available quantum computing platform. Results show that quantum annealing solver can successfully assign conflict-free RSIs. Comparison with well-known heuristics reveals that some classic algorithms are even more effective in terms of solution quality and computation time. The non-quantum advantage is due to the fact that current implementation is a semi-quantum proof-of-concept algorithm. Also, the results depend on the type of quantum computer used. Nevertheless, the proposed framework is highly flexible and holds tremendous potential for harnessing the power of quantum computing in mobile network automation.},

  abstract={In recent years, quantum computing has undergone significant developments and has established its supremacy in many application domains. While quantum hardware is accessible to the public through the cloud environment, a robust and efficient quantum circuit simulator is necessary to investigate the constraints and foster quantum computing development, such as quantum algorithm development and quantum device architecture exploration. In this paper, we observe that most of the publicly available quantum circuit simulators (e.g., QISKit from IBM, QDK from Microsoft, and Qsim-Cirq from Google) suffer from slow simulation and poor scalability when the number of qubits increases. To this end, we systematically investigate the deficiencies in quantum circuit simulation (QCS) and propose Q-GPU, a framework that leverages GPUs with comprehensive optimizations to allow efficient and scalable QCS. Specifically, Q-GPU features i) proactive state amplitude transfer, ii) zero state amplitude pruning, iii) delayed qubit involvement, and iv) lossless nonzero state amplitude compression. Experimental results across nine representative quantum circuits indicate that Q-GPU significantly reduces the execution time of the state-of-the-art GPU-based QCS by 71.89% (3.55× speedup). Q-GPU also outperforms the state-of-the-art OpenMP CPU implementation, the Google Qsim-Cirq simulator, and the Microsoft QDK simulator by 1.49×, 2.02×, and 10.82×, respectively.},

  pages={55-65},
  abstract={The ability for users to access quantum computers through the cloud has increased rapidly in recent years. Despite still being Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) machines, modern quantum computers are now being actively employed for research and by numerous startups. Quantum algorithms typically produce probabilistic results, necessitating repeated execution to produce the desired outcomes. In order for the execution to begin from the specified ground state each time and for the results of the prior execution not to interfere with the results of the subsequent execution, the reset mechanism must be performed between each iteration to effectively reset the qubits. However, due to noise and errors in quantum computers and specifically these reset mechanisms, a noisy reset operation may lead to systematic errors in the overall computation, as well as potential security and privacy vulnerabilities of information leakage. To counter this issue, we thoroughly examine the state leakage problem in quantum computing, and then propose a solution by employing the classical and quantum one-time pads before the reset mechanism to prevent the state leakage, which works by randomly applying simple gates for each execution of the circuit. In addition, this work explores conditions under which the classical one-time pad, which uses fewer resources, is sufficient to protect state leakage. Finally, we study the role of various errors in state leakage, by evaluating the degrees of leakage under different error levels of gate, measurement, and sampling errors. Our findings offer new perspectives on the design of reset mechanisms and secure quantum computing systems.},

  abstract={The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology has recently emerged as a popular area of research, and vehicle-to-cloud communication forms the basis of the IoV. This process involves uploading a large amount of information related to the vehicle and its location. The security of vehicle-to-cloud communication thus has a significant impact on the safety of the IoV. This paper proposes a vehicle-to-cloud communication system based on lightweight authentication and extended Quantum Key Distribution. The system supports the wireless distribution of session keys between vehicles and the Quantum Cloud Server (QCS) by using a WAN (Wide Area Network), and supports the wired transmission of quantum keys between the QCS and the Telematics Service Provider (TSP) through a LAN (Local Area Network) by using the BB84 protocol. The system can implement encrypted communication based on quantum physical security in a hybrid network. Moreover, we propose a lightweight identity authentication scheme. An analysis of its performance shows that the proposed system requires a small amount of computation and incurs a low communication overhead. This scheme is applicable to most Internet devices with low computing and communication capacity, and can potentially be used in the IoV framework. We conducted simulations of the proposed system and experiments to test its performance. The maximum average delay in communication in experiments was 40.681 ms and the maximum rate of packet loss was 0.1222%. The proposed system can thus ensure safe and efficient IoV communication.},

  abstract={The field of quantum computing has developed rapidly in recent years due to its promising trend of surpassing traditional machine learning in terms of speed and effectiveness. Quantum kernel learning is one of the paradigms of quantum machine learning, but the training of quantum kernel is time consuming. Therefore, this work makes the first attempt to introduce a consensus-based distributed approach to quantum kernel learning - named CDQKL - that only requires to exchange model parameter information between adjacent nodes while avoiding the need of sharing local training data. Through comparative experimental studies, the advantages of CDQKL in classification accuracy and convergence speed are verified. Considering the popularization of quantum computing cloud service and miniaturization of quantum terminals, the CDQKL adapting to this trend is able to play a vital role in data security, which implies the far-reaching significance of this work.

  abstract={Distributed cyber-infrastructures and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are transformative technologies that will play a pivotal role in the future of society and the scientific community. Internet of Things (IoT) applications harbor vast quantities of connected devices that collect a massive amount of sensitive information (e.g., medical, financial), which is usually analyzed either at the edge or federated cloud systems via AI/Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to make critical decisions (e.g., diagnosis). It is of paramount importance to ensure the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of data collection, analysis, and decision-making processes. However, system complexity and increased attack surfaces make these applications vulnerable to system breaches, single-point of failures, and various cyber-attacks. Moreover, the advances in quantum computing exacerbate the security and privacy challenges. That is, emerging quantum computers can break conventional cryptographic systems that offer cyber-security services, public key infrastructures, and privacy-enhancing technologies. Therefore, there is a vital need for new cyber-security paradigms that can address the resiliency, long-term security, and efficiency requirements of distributed cyber infrastructures.In this work, we propose a vision of distributed architecture and cyber-security framework that uniquely synergizes secure computation, Physical Quantum Key Distribution (PQKD), NIST Post- Quantum Cryptography (PQC) efforts, and AI/ML algorithms to achieve breach-resilient, functional and efficient cyber-security services. At the heart of our proposal lies a new Multi-Party Computation Quantum Network Core (MPC-QNC) that enables fast and yet quantum-safe execution of distributed computation protocols via integration of PQKD infrastructure and hardware- acceleration elements. We showcase the capabilities of MPC- QNC by instantiating it for Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) and federated ML in our HDQPKI and TPQ-ML, frameworks, respectively. HDQPKI (to the best of our knowledge) is the first hybrid and distributed post-quantum PKI that harnesses PQKD and NIST PQC standards to offer the highest level of quantum safety with a breach-resiliency against active adversaries. TPQ-ML presents a post-quantum secure and privacy-preserving federated ML infrastructure.},

  abstract={Quantum computers can solve certain problems faster than classical computers. The number of quantum computers offered via the cloud increases such that a variety is accessible for the public. However, current quantum computers still suffer from a small number of qubits and high error rates. Selecting a quantum computer providing enough qubits and low error rates is tremendously important to receive stable execution results for a given quantum circuit. The execution results are also influenced by the compilation result of the selected quantum compiler for hardware mapping and optimization. For computing time, the access is regulated by vendors of quantum computers resulting in waiting times for the user. Thus, a deep and manifold analysis of quantum computers and compiled circuits of different quantum compilers is required to estimate in advance which compiled circuit will return stable execution results also in consideration of non-functional requirements such as waiting times. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes and prioritizes compiled circuits for different quantum computers using several compilers based on the requirements of the user. We show the practical feasibility of our framework by a prototype and two use cases.},

Many researchers proposed various techniques in order to improve the RR algorithm and selecting the optimal time quantum which plays a vital role to enhance this algorithm. This paper presents a review and new classification on these techniques. Studies have been classified into two categories: RR based on static quantum, and RR based on dynamic quantum. Furthermore, the second category was divided into dynamic quantum for each round and dynamic quantum for each process. Moreover, an analytical comparison has been provided. This review can be a strong starting point for researchers who seek to enhance or optimize RR algorithm or either apply it in other fields.},

Autonomous decision making and smart manufacturing are flourishing in the current age of Industry 4.0. By providing more compute power to edge devices and connecting them to the internet, the so-called Cyber Physical Systems are prone to security threats like never before. Security in the current industry is based on cryptographic techniques that use pseudorandom number keys. Keys generated by a pseudo-random number generator pose a security threat as they can be predicted by a malicious third party. In this work, we propose a secure Industrial IoT Architecture that makes use of true random numbers generated by a quantum random number generator (QRNG). CITRIOT's FireConnect IoT node is used to show the proof of concept in a quantum-safe network where the random keys are generated by a cloud based quantum device.

  abstract={Conventional computers have evolved to device components that demonstrate failure rates of 10−17 or less, while current quantum computing devices typically exhibit error rates of 10−2 or greater. This raises concerns about the reliability and reproducibility of the results obtained from quantum computers. The problem is highlighted by experimental observation that today’s NISQ devices are inherently unstable. Remote quantum cloud servers typically do not provide users with an ability to calibrate the device themselves. Using inaccurate characterization data for error mitigation can have devastating impact on reproducibility. In this study, we investigate if one can infer the critical channel parameters dynamically from the noisy binary output of the executed quantum circuit and use it to improve program stability. An open question however is how well does this methodology scale. We discuss the efficacy and efficiency of our adaptive algorithm using canonical quantum circuits such as the uniform superposition circuit. Our metric of performance is the Hellinger distance between the post-stabilization observations and the reference (ideal) distribution.},

  abstract={Trapped-ion (TI) quantum bits are a front-runner technology for quantum computing. TI systems with multiple interconnected traps can overcome the hardware connectivity issue inherent in superconducting qubits and can solve practical problems at scale. With a sufficient number of qubits on the horizon, the multi-programming model for Quantum Computers (QC) has been proposed where multiple users share the same QC for their computing. Multi-programming is enticing for quantum cloud providers as it can maximize device utilization, throughput, and profit for clouds. Users can also benefit from the short wait queue. However, shared access to quantum computers can create new security issues. This paper presents one such vulnerability in shared TI systems that require shuttle operations for communication among traps. Repeated shuttle operations increase quantum bit energy and degrade the reliability of computations (fidelity). We show adversarial program design approaches requiring numerous shuttles. We propose a random and systematic methodology for adversary program generation. Our analysis shows shuttle-exploiting attacks can substantially degrade the fidelities of victim programs by  $\approx 2 \times $  to  $\approx 63 \times $ . Finally, we present several countermeasures such as adopting a hybrid initial mapping policy, padding victim programs with dummy qubits, and capping maximum shuttles.},

  abstract={Cloud computing has emerged as significant and paradigm shift in outsourcing storage and computations. Data stored in public cloud without encryption is not safe due to many reasons such as insider attacks, flawed hardware, security vulnerabilities and service provider stealing or deleting data for monetary gains. Therefore, it is essential for data owner to outsource data to cloud after encryption. However, the existing encryption schemes such as RSA, DES and AES, though they provide strong security, may become victims to post-quantum securityscenarios. In this paper, a hybrid security algorithm is proposed for stronger encryption and decryption procedures. The algorithm is named Multi-Layer Hybrid Security Algorithm (ML-HSA) which has multiple data transformations using AES for encryption of given data, Information Dispersal Algorithm (IDA) for ensuring data integrity and hashing for data integrity verification. The proposed scheme is evaluated using Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) cloud platform and Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service). The performance of ML-HSA is compared against state of the art security schemes such as RSA, DES andAES. Experimental results revealed that the proposed post-quantum security scheme provides stronger security with relatively less overhead due to multiple transformations involved.},

  abstract={Cloud technology has been one of the important approaches in Autonomous Vehicles (AV), which have been central to many studies in today's history. While the technology offers high computation, memory and network connectivity performance, the AV has always had little flexibility and scalability, poor location-based services and large process delays. To solve these difficulties, we combine Software Defined Networking (SDN) based central controller with fog computing in this research. SDN is a kind of network engineering that allows fog computing for intelligent and centralized network through software applications. So that SDN can be included into Fog computing for increasing network effectiveness. Hence Fog nodes send processing capabilities to the connected devices, which can dramatically reduce latencies and deliver the location services and transport protocols. Software Defined Fog Networking (SDFN) offered the adaptive central power system and basic information about the connection. Hence, we proposed a hybrid framework of SDFN- Weighed Quantum based Particle Swarm Optimization (SDFN-WQPSO) uses quantum particle motion to reach the optimal solution and achieve global convergence.

To prepare for the transition to PQC, we study the feasibility of integrating the NIST-standardized PQC digital signatures into the existing networking protocols, which include TCP/TLS and the more advanced QUIC. We study the behavior and performances of implementing PQC signatures for HTTP networking built on TCP/TLS and QUIC. Our experiment-based studies use remote cloud servers across the globe to simulate and measure the real-world networking behaviors. Focusing on the post-quantum lattice-based ciphers of Dilithium and Falcon, our results show that QUIC generally outperforms TCP/TLS (by 52% with RSA, 2.5% or greater with Dilithium algorithms, and 32.8 % or greater with Falcon algorithms). Based on the QUIC performances and the protocol handshake duration overhead between the client and the cloud server, we recommend Falcon for the QUIC-based networking applications for quicker handshake and less variance if the devices can afford the hardware for floating-point-based operations.},

  year={2024},
  volume={23},
  number={10},
  pages={10077-10092},
  abstract={The rapid development of cloud computing and the exponential growth of data have led to an increasing demand for secure data sharing and querying. Proxy re-encryption (PRE) addresses the issue of secure data sharing, since it enables controlled data sharing and delegation of access rights without revealing the actual content of the encrypted data stored in the cloud; public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) tackles the issue of secure data querying, since it allows resource-constrained clients to effectively search over encrypted data stored in the cloud. As a combination of PRE and PEKS, proxy re-encryption with keyword search (PRES) enables both secure data sharing and querying. Despite their merits, existing PRES schemes are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks, keyword guessing attacks (KGAs), or incur high end-to-end delay. To address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a novel cryptographic primitive called public-key authenticated re-encryption with keyword search (Re-PAEKS), which combines the strengths of PRE and public-key authenticated encryption with keyword search (PAEKS). Our Re-PAEKS has low end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and KGAs. Technically, we improve the previous lattice-based PAEKS scheme and achieve the delegation of access rights by exploiting the lattice-based identity-based encryption (IBE) techniques, which are widely believed to be secure against quantum computer attacks. In addition, we formalize the security model of the Re-PAEKS and prove its security in the random oracle model. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of the Re-PAEKS, and the experimental results show that the Re-PAEKS is computationally efficient and practical. Particularly, the Re-PAEKS enjoys the lowest end-to-end delay compared to current state-of-the-art PRES.},

  abstract={Cloud-assisted Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) relies on cloud computing to provide massive data storage services. To ensure the confidentiality, sensitive industrial data need to be encrypted before being outsourced to cloud storage server. Public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) enables users to search target encrypted data by keywords. However, most existing PEKS schemes are based on conventional hardness assumptions, which are vulnerable to adversaries equipped with quantum computers in the near future. Moreover, they suffer from key exposure, and thus the security would be broken once the keys are compromised. In this paper, we propose a forward secure PEKS scheme (FS-PEKS) based on lattice assumptions for cloud-assisted IIoT, which is post-quantum secure. We integrate a lattice-based delegation mechanism into FS-PEKS to achieve forward security, such that the security of the system is still guaranteed even the keys are compromised by the adversaries. We define the first formal security model on forward security of PEKS, and prove the security of FS-PEKS under the model. As the keywords of industrial data are with inherently low entropy, we further extend FS-PEKS to resist insider keyword guessing attacks (IKGA). The comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates that FS-PEKS is practical for cloud-assisted IIoT.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of cloud storage and quantum computing, ensuring the integrity of the outsourced data for data owners becomes a serious concern. To address this problem, the existing protocols for auditing cloud storage are usually based on the post-quantum cryptographies to check data integrity. Nevertheless, these protocols employ heavy cryptographic operations to construct the data tags, making their efficiency low and extensibility poor. In this paper, we take a new perspective and explore the possibility of designing secure cloud storage (SCS) protocols based on the ring learning with errors problem. Instead of matrix variables, our protocol only utilizes vector variables to generate data block tags so that it has a much lower computational complexity. We then give a strict security proof of cheating resistance against the malicious cloud and privacy guarantee against the curious third-party auditor. We also extend the proposed protocol to support data dynamics and batch auditing for more application scenarios. As a further contribution, we summarize a systematic framework for designing the lattice-based SCS protocols. Finally, exhaustive performance analysis and comparison are provided to verify that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing lattice-based SCS protocols in terms of both operational efficiency and functional extensibility.},

  abstract={Datacenter networks (DCNs) with cloud–edge collaboration are emerging to satisfy the communication, computation, and caching (3C) requirements of future services such as cloud-based IoT services. However, the enroute data over DCNs with cloud–edge collaboration is likely to suffer from cyberattacks such as eavesdropping. A large number of services require not only 3C resources, but also cryptographic resources for encryption to ensure high security. Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a practical approach to provide secret keys for remote users with information-theoretic security against attacks from quantum computing. A QKD-secured DCN (QKD-DCN) with cloud–edge collaboration can be deployed to satisfy the communication, computation, caching, and cryptographic (4C) requirements of services. This article innovatively solves the new 4C resource-allocation (4CRA) problem in the network to minimize the cryptographic resource consumption. It formulates an integer linear programming (ILP) model and proposes a heuristic cryptographic-dependent 4CRA algorithm to find optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is compared with two baseline 4CRA algorithms which, respectively, consider the minimized service delivery latency and the first-fit resource availability. Analytical simulations show that the proposed algorithm minimizes the key-resource-consumption ratio and the average key-resource consumption under static and dynamic traffic scenarios in different network topologies.},

  abstract={Many classical cryptographic techniques are breakable due to the quantum computing security threats, and it leads to design public key cryptography based on post-quantum cryptography primitives and security protocols. In recent years, Lattice-Based Cryptography (LBC) becomes a prominent post-quantum cryptographic primitive that can be applied in both traditional and emerging security domains, including encryption, key agreement, digital signature and homomorphic encryption. In this article, we first provide a LBC-based security framework using aggregate signature that can be applied in ambient intelligence-assisted blockchain-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications, called LAS-AIBIoT. In LAS-AIBIoT, the wearable/medical devices deployed in the patients' body securely send the sensing secret data (encrypted messages) with their respective lattice-based signatures to their nearby controller nodes (CN), where the CNs forward these secret messages to the attached aggregator node (Aggr). Each Aggr verifies the individual signature of the devices and constructs the aggregate signature on the received secret messages and signatures, and sends the aggregated secret messages with their aggregate signature to the cloud server(s) for block construction in the blockchain center. Through the consensus protocol, the block is then mined and added into the blokchain. We show the robustness of LAS-AIBIoT against various potential attacks including quantum computing security threats through the threat model discussed in this article. Finally, through the blockchain-based simulation study we show that LAS-AIBIoT can be applied for real-time ambient intelligence-assisted IoT applications.},

  abstract={Driven by cloud computing technologies, public-key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is becoming a common practice from aspects of the Industrial Internet of Things, smart healthcare, vehicular social networks, and so on. However, a dozen years of PEKS development is accompanied by some security and privacy issues in the encrypted data search and access processes. The keyword guessing attack is a typical user privacy threat model, that is, an adversary could guess the user’s retrieval keyword given a search trapdoor. On the other hand, the emergence of quantum computers make traditional PEKS schemes no longer secure. Although scholars put forward some postquantum secure PEKS schemes, these schemes are based on lattice cryptography with a larger key size. To the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum-resist PEKS scheme established on elliptic curve cryptography. This article utilizes PEKS with designated tester primitive and quantum resistance of isogeny. Then, we put forward a postquantum searchable encryption scheme named Isoga, which fights against keyword guessing attacks. We prove Isoga’s searchable ciphertext security and trapdoor indistinguishability under isogeny-related difficult assumptions. Performance evaluation indicates that the Isoga scheme is more practical in the quantum environment, considering seven schemes’ security properties, communication cost, and computing overload among.},

  abstract={Advances in medical science and technology continue to drive the development of e-healthcare, with Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) consisting of medical information such as patient consultation records and bodily data being gradually popularized in the form of cloud sharing. The sharing of EMR effectively enhances the effectiveness and reliability of healthcare services. However, the highly sensitive EMRs are susceptible to tampering and misuse during the EMR sharing, which poses a tremendous threat to patients’ privacy and the security of e-health. Further, EMRs are extremely vulnerable to quantum computing attacks during the process of sharing in cloud, which will be the most significant bottleneck in the advancement of e-healthcare systems. To tackle the foregoing issues, we present a lattice-based ring signature scheme for secure EMR sharing on the cloud. To begin with, we implement EMR sharing with medical cloud. Then, we set a lattice-based ring signature scheme to ensure user anonymity, EMR and signature unforgeability, while resisting quantum attacks. Further, we require all EMR-related users to perform multiparty confirmation signatures on the EMR. In conlusion, the security analysis and performance evaluation indicate that our scheme guarantees correctness, anonymity, and unforgeability, while outperforming other existing schemes.},

Cloud suppliers, in order to keep their services available, need to reduce the amount of power their platforms need without sacrificing quality of service. As a result, studies have recommended a cloud-specific architecture that optimizes energy use throughout the whole computer infrastructure. The suggested method was developed in the CloudSim simulator, and the results of the associated simulations suggest that power consumption may be substantial and varies depending on parameters like the quantum variable, data size, and the number of VMs operating on a host. It is possible to establish a variety of resource allocation and planning methods for amassing virtual machines (VMs) on fewer hosts while still maintaining critical metrics, making cloud technology the first step towards sustainable energy.

  abstract={To reduce data storage costs, more individuals are using cloud servers for reliable, scalable, cost-effective, and globally accessible solutions. However, storing data in plaintext on cloud servers can lead to data leakage risks. Moreover, the advancement of quantum computing poses a threat to traditional encryption algorithms. To counter quantum computing attacks and enable searches over encrypted keywords, lattice-based searchable encryption with conjunctive keyword search has been implemented. Nonetheless, existing schemes expose keyword fields and leaks additional information. To mitigate this, we propose a privacy-preserving method based on lattice hardness assumptions. It enables testing the existence of an encrypted keyword in a set of encrypted keywords without requiring the keyword fields. Additionally, we propose two improved methods: one for inclusion-based searches between two keyword sets, and another for range-based keyword searches. These form the basis for three lattice-based identity-based searchable encryption schemes that support disjunctive, conjunctive, and range keyword searches, respectively. The storage overhead of ciphertexts and trapdoors is unaffected by the number of keywords, making our scheme suitable for multi-keyword search scenarios.

  abstract={The 1980s saw networks begin a transition from copper-cable moderated growth to an acceleration of creativity powered by optical fibre and mobile technology. The widespread digital connectivity of people and machines led to mobile working, social media, eCommerce, Cloud Computing, and over-the-top (OTT) media services. Throughout this era, network providers failed to anticipate, and satisfy, the manifest growth potential despite demonstrably solid Moore’s Law (related) predictions. They also failed to recognise mounting energy costs and the coming crisis posed by the expansion of cloud computing, networked Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), $5 / 6 \mathrm{G}$, and (possibly) quantum computing! In this session we review the status quo and propose some radical solutions to the likely energy demands of a growing IoT.},

  abstract={Several researchers are now able to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations that can mimic the behaviour of a large number of atoms thanks to the emergence of big data and improvements in computing power. Large amounts of data are produced by these simulations, which can be processed, saved, and analysed using big data and cloud computing technologies. These algorithms can be applied to optimise the behaviour of quantum systems as well as forecast the characteristics of materials. We discuss the implementation of molecular dynamics simulations and aim to study the computational time for different number of atoms in simulation of a parallel computing model based on molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics is an essential tool for understanding molecular reactions, and we aim to study the computational methods to make it faster and more accurate. However, such simulations may be computationally inefficient and memory-costly. The proposed solution is to parallelise the simulation algorithm, which could be a small step towards a larger solution. We propose a Charm++ based parallel algorithm that helps process large amount of big data and may see potential success in quantum computing.},

  abstract={Present-day quantum computers suffer from various noises or errors such as, gate error, relaxation, dephasing, readout error, and crosstalk. Besides, they offer a limited number of qubits with restrictive connectivity. Therefore, quantum programs running these computers face resilience issues and low output fidelities. The noise in the cloud-based access of quantum computers also introduce new modes of security and privacy issues. Furthermore, quantum computers face several threat models from insider and outsider adversaries including input tampering, program misallocation, fault injection, Reverse Engineering (RE) and Cloning. This paper provides an overview of various assets embedded in quantum computers and programs, vulnerabilities and attack models and the relation between resilience and security. We also cover countermeasures against the reliability and security issues and present future outlook for security of quantum computing.},

  pages={115270-115291},
  abstract={The coming advent of Quantum Computing promises to jeopardize current communications security, undermining the effectiveness of traditional public-key based cryptography. Different strategies (Post-Quantum or Quantum Cryptography) have been proposed to address this problem. Many techniques and algorithms based on quantum phenomena have been presented in recent years; the most relevant example is the introduction of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD). This approach allows to exchange cryptographic keys among parties and does not suffer from the development of quantum computation. Problems arise when this technique has to be deployed and combined with modern distributed infrastructures that heavily depend on cloud and virtualisation paradigms. This paper addresses the issue by presenting a new software stack that effortlessly introduces QKD in such environments. This software stack allows for agnostic integration, monitoring, and management of QKD, independent from a specific vendor or technology. Furthermore, a QKD simulator is presented, designed, and tested. This latter contribution is suitable as a low-level testing device, as an independent software module to check QKD protocols, and as a testbed to identify future practical enhancements.},

  abstract={In this work, we aim to solve a practical use-case of unsupervised clustering that has applications in predictive maintenance in the energy operations sector using quantum computers. Using only cloud access to quantum computers, we complete thorough performance analysis of what some current quantum computing systems are capable of for practical applications involving nontrivial mid-to-high-dimensional datasets. We first benchmark how well distance estimation can be performed using two different metrics based on the swap-test, using angle and amplitude data embedding. Next, for the clustering performance analysis, we generate sets of synthetic data with varying cluster variance and compare simulation to physical hardware results using the two metrics. From the results of this performance analysis, we propose a general, competitive, and parallelized version of quantum $k$-means clustering to avoid some pitfalls discovered due to noisy hardware and apply the approach to a real energy grid clustering scenario. Using real-world German electricity grid data, we show that the new approach improves the balanced accuracy of the standard quantum $k$-means clustering by 67.8% with respect to the labeling of the classical algorithm.},

  year={2023},
  volume={4},
  number={},
  pages={1-21},
  abstract={Quantum annealing is a specialized type of quantum computation that aims to use quantum fluctuations in order to obtain global minimum solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Programmable D-Wave quantum annealers are available as cloud computing resources, which allow users low-level access to quantum annealing control features. In this article, we are interested in improving the quality of the solutions returned by a quantum annealer by encoding an initial state into the annealing process. We explore two D-Wave features that allow one to encode such an initial state: the reverse annealing (RA) and the h-gain (HG) features. RA aims to refine a known solution following an anneal path starting with a classical state representing a good solution, going backward to a point where a transverse field is present, and then finishing the annealing process with a forward anneal. The HG feature allows one to put a time-dependent weighting scheme on linear ($h$) biases of the Hamiltonian, and we demonstrate that this feature likewise can be used to bias the annealing to start from an initial state. We also consider a hybrid method consisting of a backward phase resembling RA and a forward phase using the HG initial state encoding. Importantly, we investigate the idea of iteratively applying RA and HG to a problem, with the goal of monotonically improving on an initial state that is not optimal. The HG encoding technique is evaluated on a variety of input problems including the edge-weighted maximum cut problem and the vertex-weighted maximum clique problem, demonstrating that the HG technique is a viable alternative to RA for some problems. We also investigate how the iterative procedures perform for both RA and HG initial state encodings on random whole-chip spin glasses with the native hardware connectivity of the D-Wave Chimera and Pegasus chips.},

  abstract={Accurately predicting a quantum computer's capability—which circuits it can run and how well it can run them—is a foundational goal of quantum characterization and benchmarking. As modern quantum computers become increasingly hard to simulate, we must develop accurate and scalable predictive capability models to help researchers and stakeholders decide which quantum computers to build and use. In this work, we propose a hardware-agnostic method to efficiently construct scalable predictive models of a quantum computer's capability for almost any class of circuits and demonstrate our method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our CNN-based approach works by efficiently representing a circuit as a 3-D tensor and then using a CNN to predict its success rate. Our CNN capability models obtain approximately a 1% average absolute prediction error when modeling processors experiencing both Markovian and non-Markovian stochastic Pauli errors. We also apply our CNNs to model the capabilities of cloud-access quantum computing systems, obtaining moderate prediction accuracy (average absolute error around 2–5%), and we highlight the challenges to building better neural network capability models.},

The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add functionality using any language or environment.

  abstract={Data integrity has become an extremely important security issue in cloud-assisted wireless body area networks (WBANs). As accurate medical diagnostic analysis is heavily based on outsourced electronic medical data in cloud storage, any corrupted data may lead to fateful consequences. Data auditing contributes to medical data integrity verification, but most of existing data auditing schemes are vulnerable to attackers equipped with practical quantum-computing devices, which are very likely to be invented in the near future. Besides, in many scenarios, a patient has no capability to execute medical data integrity verification personally, he/she has to specify a verifier to complete data auditing. To this end, we present an efficient lattice-based designated verifier auditing scheme (LDVAS), which could be well deployed in cloud-assisted WBANs. In particular, LDVAS enables a patient to designate a unique verifier to execute data auditing in post-quantum secure settings, and any others cannot fulfil such task without the approval of the patient. We formally prove the security of LDVAS based on the hardness assumptions of lattice-based problems. The performance evaluation demonstrates the high efficiency and feasibility of LDVAS on the side of the designated verifier.},

  abstract={The term "optimization" refers to the process of identifying the best solution for a given problem. Optimization techniques such as TSP, categorization, scan, and ERP systems are used to solve a variety of real-world problems. Scheduling is an important domain of the optimization technique, and it is one of their primary application fields. The primary goal of this paper is to investigate and optimize cloud computing-based resource scheduling techniques. As a result, this paper proposes a quantum genetics-based resource allocation optimization strategy. The technique starts with quantum physics for encoding and population generation, then moves on to a genetic algorithm for searching the generated population. Following a search, the genetic algorithm returns resource sequences that match the search criteria, as well as a task list. The CPU consumption cycles are efficiently minimized by using the resulting sequences. The CloudSim simulation tool is also used to test the efficacy of the proposed algorithm for resource scheduling. Finally, the system's output is determined by the algorithm's time complexity, space complexity, and CPU usage cycles. A comparison analysis of historically available resource allocation techniques is also carried out and compared to similar criteria. When compared to conventional resource allocation techniques, experimental findings indicate that the proposed quantum genetics concept provides superior efficiency.},

  abstract={Network slicing is a powerful tool that provides 5G and future networks a robust means for managing cross-application QoS, dynamic traffic migration in response to network events, and in-network data aggregation and computation. Unfortunately, slicing inherits many of the security challenges of cloud and edge computing such as side-channel information leakage, while also encountering new challenges posed by multi-domain authorization and quantum computing. Many extant mechanisms, such as PKI, are insufficient in the face of quantum computers, and existing side-channel mitigations impose heavy overhead costs while only providing defense against known attacks. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to protecting slice control information through the use of Homomorphic Encryption (HE). HE allows quantum-resilient validation and distribution of critical information, while also enabling hierarchical control across multiple domains and providing encrypted computation. Further, threshold HE enables secure decryption and computation of control or measurement information, while protecting the entire slice against potential key-leakage by rendering any one key useless without the required quorum. The benchmark results shown demonstrate that the HE mechanisms used can be deployed in a practical manner, providing stalwart security guarantees against a variety of threats.},

At the same time, the emergence of new computing paradigms, such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Everything, demand that innovations in security extend beyond their foundational aspects, to the actual design and deployment of these primitives and protocols while satisfying emerging design constraints such as latency, compactness, energy efficiency, and agility. While many alternatives have been proposed for symmetric key cryptography and related protocols (e.g., lightweight ciphers and authenticated encryption), the alternatives for public key cryptography are limited to post-quantum cryptography primitives and their protocols. In particular, lattice-based cryptography is a promising candidate, both in terms of foundational properties, as well as its application to traditional security problems such as key exchange, digital signature, and encryption/decryption. We summarize trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some fundamental recent proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs.},

  abstract={The proliferation of ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and smart devices in several domains embracing healthcare, Industry 4.0, transportation and agriculture are giving rise to a prodigious amount of data requiring ever-increasing computations and services from cloud to the edge of the network. Fog/Edge computing is a promising and distributed computing paradigm that has drawn extensive attention from both industry and academia. The infrastructural efficiency of these computing paradigms necessitates adaptive resource management mechanisms for offloading decisions and efficient scheduling. Resource Management (RM) is a non-trivial issue whose complexity is the result of heterogeneous resources, incoming transactional workload, edge node discovery, and Quality of Service (QoS) parameters at the same time, which makes the efficacy of resources even more challenging. Hence, the researchers have adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to resolve the above-mentioned issues. This paper offers a comprehensive review of resource management issues and challenges in Fog/Edge paradigm by categorizing them into provisioning of computing resources, task offloading, resource scheduling, service placement, and load balancing. In addition, existing AI and non-AI based state-of-the-art solutions have been discussed, along with their QoS metrics, datasets analysed, limitations and challenges. The survey provides mathematical formulation corresponding to each categorized resource management issue. Our work sheds light on promising research directions on cutting-edge technologies such as Serverless computing, 5G, Industrial IoT (IIoT), blockchain, digital twins, quantum computing, and Software-Defined Networking (SDN), which can be integrated with the existing frameworks of fog/edge-of-things paradigms to improve business intelligence and analytics amongst IoT-based applications.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a notable amount of research on developing cryptographic schemes that are secure against both quantum and classical computers. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a process to solicit, evaluate, and standardize one or more quantum-resistant public key cryptographic schemes. This process originated because quantum computers can exploit quantum mechanical phenomena and solve mathematical problems that are difficult or intractable for classical computers. This kind of mathematical problem is the basis of secure public key cryptography. As a consequence, in a near future quantum computers will be able to break many of the public key schemes currently in use. However, the challenge is especially acute for devices with different architectures. They might not be well equipped to run the new standards and interoperate with existing communication protocols and networks. In this work, we analyze the performance of postquantum schemes in the transport layer security (TLS) protocol considering x86 as the server architecture and x86/ARM architectures as clients. All of them lack cloud computing or virtualized environments. Our analysis considers integrating the implementation of two cryptographic schemes that were successful in the second round of the postquantum standardization process, namely, Dilithium and New Hope. The performance of postquantum schemes in the TLS protocol is statistically analyzed in x86 and ARM architectures, giving the relationships, the effects and the survival of the analysis.},

  abstract={Current cryptographic solutions used in information technologies today like Transport Layer Security utilize algorithms with underlying computationally difficult problems to solve. With the ongoing research and development of quantum computers, these same computationally difficult problems become solvable within reasonable (polynomial) time. The emergence of large-scale quantum computers would put the integrity and confidentiality of today’s data in jeopardy. It then becomes urgent to develop, implement, and test a new suite of cybersecurity measures against attacks from a quantum computer. This paper explores, understands, and evaluates this new category of cryptosystems as well as the many tradeoffs among them. All the algorithms submitted to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for standardization can be categorized into three major categories, each relating to the new underlying hard problem: namely error code correcting, algebraic lattices (including ring learning with errors), and supersingular isogenies. These new mathematical hard problems have shown to be resistant to the same type of quantum attack. Utilizing hardware clock cycle registers, the work sets up the benchmarks of the four Round 3 NIST algorithms in two environments: cloud computing and embedded system. As expected, there are many tradeoffs and advantages in each algorithm for applications. Saber and Kyber are exceedingly fast but have larger ciphertext size for transmission over a wire. McEliece key size and key generation are the largest drawbacks but having the smallest ciphertext size and only slightly decreased performance allow a use case where key reuse is prioritized. NTRU finds a middle ground in these tradeoffs, being better than McEliece performance wise and better than Kyber and Saber in ciphertext size allows for a use case of highly varied environments, which need to value speed and ciphertext size equally. Going forward, the benchmarking system developed could be applied to digital signature, another vital aspect to a cryptosystem.},

  abstract={Modern cloud/edge architectures need to orchestrate multiple layers of heterogeneous computing nodes, including pervasive sensors/actuators, distributed edge/fog nodes, centralized data centers, and quantum devices. The optimal assignment and scheduling of computation on the different nodes is a very difficult problem, with NP-hard complexity. In this article, we explore the possibility of solving this problem with variational quantum algorithms, which can become a viable alternative to classical algorithms in the near future. In particular, we compare the performance, in terms of success probability, of two algorithms, i.e., quantum approximate optimization algorithm and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). The simulation experiments, performed for a set of simple problems, show that the VQE algorithm ensures better performance when it is equipped with appropriate circuit ansatzes that are able to restrict the search space. Moreover, experiments executed on real quantum hardware show that the execution time, when increasing the size of the problem, grows much more slowly than the trend obtained with classical computation, which is known to be exponential.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of cloud computing and the exponential growth of data highlight the need for secure data sharing and querying. Attribute-based keyword search (ABKS) has emerged as an efficient means of searching encrypted data stored in the cloud. However, existing ABKS schemes incur high end-to-end delay and are vulnerable to quantum computer attacks and/or (insider) keyword guessing attacks (KGA). To address these vulnerabilities, this paper introduces a new concept called attribute-based authenticated encryption with keyword search (ABAEKS) and proposes an efficient ABAEKS scheme. Our ABAEKS has low end-to-end delay, and is resistant to both quantum computer attacks and (insider) KGA. In addition, we formalize the security model of ABAEKS system and prove its security in the random oracle model. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of ABAEKS, and the experimental results show that our ABAEKS is computationally efficient and outperforms current state-of-the-art ABKS schemes.},

  abstract={Superconductive logic based on Josephson junctions (JJ) is a promising technology for energy efficient supercomputers and cloud computing. This technology can deliver significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency as compared to CMOS. Superconductive circuits, however, suffer from low density integration as compared to CMOS, primarily due to the limited scalability of the inductors. To improve the scalability of superconductive logic, a logic family based on a novel JJ technology,  $2\phi $ -JJ, has been proposed that eliminates the inductors. In this brief, three circuits are presented which exploit this scalable inductor-less technology. This novel  $2\phi $ -JJ technology represents the data as half flux quantum (HFQ) pulses, which improves the energy efficiency and speed as compared to standard superconductive logic such as rapid single flux quantum (RSFQ). Unlike RSFQ, the proposed circuits dynamically switch upon receiving an HFQ pulse, saving energy. These  $2\phi $ -JJ logic circuits operate 2.25X faster and require 2.6X less energy as compared to RSFQ.},

  abstract={Searchable encryption enables secure searches over encrypted data in the cloud. Among all paradigms, public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS) is particularly desirable by privacy-preserving distributed computing and IoT applications, since it allows multiple parties (i.e., writers) to independently contribute encrypted data. However, a PEKS search usually requires a linear scan over the entire dataset for keyword search, causing unacceptable latency when facing a large amount of data. All existing efforts to speed up multi-writer searchable encryption are based on conventional hardness assumptions for security, which can be broken provided the advent of quantum computers. In this work, we propose a lattice-based multi-writer searchable encryption scheme, which lets writers build indices for their outsourced data to make keyword searches faster. Meanwhile, the security of the proposed solution relies on the learning with errors assumption, which is known to withstand the potential attack from quantum computers.},

  pages={55732-55743},
  abstract={To ensure the integrity of cloud storage, it is necessary for data owners to launch data integrity auditing (DIA) periodically. To fit more application scenarios, the research direction is shifted to design identity-based DIA (ID-DIA) protocols without expensive public key infrastructure, which can resist the quantum computing attacks simultaneously. However, the existing ID-DIA protocols are usually based on heavy anti-quantum computing cryptographies, which might severely limit their practical deployments. To address this problem, we explore three ways to design RLWE-based ID-DIA (ID-DIA-RLWE) protocols. The first is to improve the existing LWE-based ID-DIA protocols. The second is to enhance the existing RLWE-based DIA protocols. The third is to instantiate the proposed semantic ID-DIA protocol. Among these three proposed protocols, the third one is the most efficient due to its simplest construction. We also propose a new security model of ID-DIA protocols, including correctness assurance, security guarantee, and privacy protection. Then, we provide theoretical analysis of all proposed ID-DIA protocols under the given security model. Finally, we conduct extensive performance evaluation and comparison, which further validate that the third protocol has superiority in the perspectives of computation, communication, and storage costs.},

  pages={75965-75982},
  abstract={Spectral clustering, a powerful algorithm in the field of AI, holds a significant role despite its inherent high time complexity. For data owners grappling with limitations such as small datasets and restricted computational resources, harnessing the computational capabilities of cloud computing and aggregating data from multiple sources can yield precise spectral clustering results. However, explicit data uploading to cloud servers poses privacy risks. In response to this challenge, we explore the outsourcing dilemma of spectral clustering in a cloud and multi-user environment and propose a quantum-secure and efficient solution. Specifically, by employing the CKKS homomorphic encryption algorithm within a dual non-collusive server model, we formulate a comprehensive and multi-user spectral clustering outsourcing scheme. Our approach addresses privacy concerns by introducing secure computation protocols for  $L_{2}$  norm, exponential function, and negative half power function. We elaborate on efficient computational algorithms for each stage of spectral clustering, ensuring accurate clustering outcomes without compromising dataset privacy. Moreover, in our scheme, users only need to upload their encrypted dataset without requiring direct interaction with each other or the cloud server until obtaining clustering results. Finally, we argue the IND- $\mathcal {CPA}$  security of our design and substantiate its accuracy and efficiency through theoretical comparison analysis and experimental evaluations.},

  abstract={In the evolving landscape of cloud computing, data security remains a paramount concern, necessitated by the increasing sophistication of cyber threats. Traditional encryption methodologies, primarily Single-Tier systems, are proving insufficient against the advanced tactics employed by modern cyber attackers. The CloudSec Innovation introduces a novel Multi-Tier encryption framework designed to fortify cloud data security by integrating symmetric (AES-256), asymmetric (RSA-OAEP), and post-quantum (Kyber-512) encryption techniques. The system is rigorously evaluated using a dataset simulated to mirror diverse cyber-attack scenarios and data sensitivity levels. The experimental analysis demonstrates a significant enhancement in security efficacy; the Multi-Tier system drastically reduces the success rate of cyber attacks to 5% from the 25% seen with Single-Tier systems, while also prolonging the average breach time from 2 to $\mathbf{1 0}$ hours. These results, tested across scenarios like SQL Injection, Brute Force, and Phishing attacks, attest to the robustness and comprehensive protection offered by the MultiTier approach. Conclusively, ‘CloudSec Innovation’ emerges as a superior solution, providing a sophisticated and layered defense mechanism that is adept at securing sensitive data in cloud environments against an array of cyber threats, thus establishing a new benchmark in cloud data encryption technology.},

  abstract={Data Processing Units (DPUs) are becoming increasingly popular, especially for use in conjunction with Warehouse-Scale Computers (WSCs) due to their ability to handle networking functions and data-centric workloads. Cost-performance, energy efficiency, network 1/0, and batch processing workloads are important design factors for WSCs. Recent developments in AI and the never-ending increase in demand for data processing, cloud computing, and HPC set the optimisation of all those design factors as a high priority. DPUs can be utilised to achieve significant improvements in all those areas. This includes in-line network processing and upcoming enhanced security paradigms such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC) for quantum re-silient communications or software-defined perimeters (SDP) for confidential computing implementations. Being P4-enabled and dRMT-based, DPUs allow for the reconfigurability of the network traffic without the need to change the hardware. However, the network performance on such devices is only sometimes deter-ministic since the actual traffic and the rules, both of which have to do with packet processing, are not known during compile time. In this paper, we envision how the network performance on DPUs can be accelerated. We describe the challenges that negatively impact the bandwidth and latency: the complex steering pipeline and the massive runtime needed to optimise. These challenges arise from the lack of information during compile time that is only known during runtime. Thus, we envision optimising during runtime by leveraging DPUs' reconfigurability on the network 110. For this, we discuss the significant factors that must be considered to accelerate the network performance on such devices and we propose a solution for them.},

Its diverse applications hod the potential to revolutionize multiple facets of Industry 4.0 and serve as a cornerstone for the rise of Industry 5.0. However, current systems are still not effective in providing a high-quality experience for users due to various factors, one of which is their limited resources for processing and transmitting complex data and big data.

  abstract={Edge computing brings data computation and storage closer to the mobile device to save response time for decision making. After being processed at the edge, commonly the data will be uploaded to the cloud for further enriched analysis. For privacy concerns, local devices may encrypt the collected data before sending it to the cloud server. However, this treatment increases the server's processing time and makes it hard to pick out the desired data. In this article, to address this problem, we design an encrypted data validation scheme, which enables the edge to clean the encrypted data to be uploaded. Because edge computing encompasses numerous edge devices from different service providers, we explore the public-key cryptographic mechanism to implement our secure data validation scheme. Considering potential risks from quantum computers, we propose to leverage ideal lattice to realize our protocol, which reaches better performance in both time and storage for edge devices. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed proposal achieves considerable performance improvements in terms of communication and computation aspects. Particularly, compared to prior work, nearly 123×-238× speed up is achieved in our key derivation procedure and the storage cost of the secret key is reduced from 547MB to 1.7MB.},

This paper presents a novel approach to foster fair decision-making by tackling social bias and enhancing transparency in machine learning models. The proposed framework leverages quantum-inspired complex-valued neural networks and attention-based networks, offering improved transparency in modeling the decision process for interpreting feature importance and dependency. Furthermore, our approach tackles the challenges posed by imbalanced data through the incorporation of focal loss and oversampling techniques, resulting in reduced prediction errors. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-life datasets encompassing criminal charge prediction, financial fraud detection, and credit card default payment prediction, our approach consistently demonstrates reliable prediction precision and recall. Notably, our analysis of feature significance highlights the statistical importance of task-related features such as historical records of bank transactions or criminal charge history, while socially biased identifiers like race, gender, and age exhibit minimal significance. By excluding these biased features, our approach enhances fairness without compromising prediction accuracy, thereby contributing to the advancement of fair decision-making in big data and cloud computing across various high-stake domains.},

  abstract={We observe a continuously increased use of Deep Learning (DL) as a specific type of Machine Learning (ML) for data-intensive problems (i.e., ’big data’) that requires powerful computing resources with equally increasing performance. Consequently, innovative heterogeneous High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems based on multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs require an architectural design that addresses end user communities’ requirements that take advantage of ML and DL. Still the workloads of end user communities of the simulation sciences (e.g., using numerical methods based on known physical laws) needs to be equally supported in those architectures. This paper offers insights into the Modular Supercomputer Architecture (MSA) developed in the Dynamic Exascale Entry Platform (DEEP) series of projects to address the requirements of both simulation sciences and data-intensive sciences such as High Performance Data Analytics (HPDA). It shares insights into implementing the MSA in the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) hosting Europe No. 1 Supercomputer Jülich Wizard for European Leadership Science (JUWELS). We augment the technical findings with experience and lessons learned from two application communities case studies (i.e., remote sensing and health sciences) using the MSA with JUWELS and the DEEP systems in practice. Thus, the paper provides details into specific MSA design elements that enable significant performance improvements of ML and DL algorithms. While this paper focuses on MSA-based HPC systems and application experience, we are not losing sight of advances in Cloud Computing (CC) and Quantum Computing (QC) relevant for ML and DL.},

In addition, a Self Balanced Adaptive Differential Evolution (SB-ADE) algorithm is developed to optimize qubit network weights. The accuracy of the EQNN prediction model is extensively evaluated and compared with seven state-of-the-art methods using eight real world benchmark datasets of three different categories. Experimental results reveal that the use of the quantum approach to evolutionary neural network substantially improves the prediction accuracy up to 91.6 percent over the existing approaches.},

  abstract={Modern healthcare systems are known for being extremely complicated and expensive. On the other hand, improved health record management can help lessen this. The Electronic Health Records (EHR) sharing system is cutting-edge healthcare delivery. The system’s tools can anticipate results throughout a patient’s life, measure treatment efficacy, follow therapy, and detect human errors. Centralized and cloud-based systems are susceptible to security attacks and illegal modifications that can cause privacy issues and sometimes life-threatening situations. Integrity and interoperability across the treatment continuum are top priorities for major industry players. Given the massive amount of EHR data, security concerns, and variety of healthcare information systems, achieving this aim remains a challenge. Blockchain is an immutable ledger used in EHR systems due to its inherent immutability and privacy attributes. Blockchain-based systems are reliable and efficient. Another advantage of the Blockchain application in healthcare record management is the increased interoperability of records that can further help in better availability of the patient’s records resulting in better healthcare opportunities and collaboration. Quantum computing developments threaten such systems as quantum computers can easily break the algorithms assumed to be impossible to crack in years. This paper reviews the application of Blockchain in EHR, possible challenges, and quantum computers’ effect on the reliability and security of Blockchain-based EHR systems.},

While the employment of quantum computers for supporting Quantum Machine Learning emerged as a viable solution to overcome this issue, their integration within a network architecture still represents an uncovered research topic. To bridge this gap, this paper illustrates the design principles of centralized and distributed architectures, where quantum computers are deployed in the remote cloud or geographically distributed at the edge, respectively. The advantages and disadvantages of the resulting network architectures are investigated to point out open issues and future research directions.},

  year={2024},

  number={},
  pages={1-15},
  abstract={Demand-side response (DSR) is a strategy that enables consumers to actively participate in managing electricity demand. It aims to alleviate strain on the grid during high demand and promote a more balanced and efficient use of (renewable) electricity resources. We implement DSR through discount scheduling, which involves offering discrete price incentives to consumers to adjust their electricity consumption patterns to times when their local energy mix consists of more renewable energy. Since we tailor the discounts to individual customers' consumption, the discount scheduling problem (DSP) becomes a large combinatorial optimization task. Consequently, we adopt a hybrid quantum computing approach, using D-Wave's Leap Hybrid Cloud. We benchmark Leap against Gurobi, a classical mixed-integer optimizer, in terms of solution quality at fixed runtime and fairness in terms of discount allocation. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale decomposition algorithm/heuristic for the DSP, applied with either quantum or classical computers running the subroutines, which significantly reduces the problem size while maintaining solution quality. Using synthetic data generated from real-world data, we observe that the classical decomposition method obtains the best overall solution quality for problem sizes up to 3200 consumers; however, the hybrid quantum approach provides more evenly distributed discounts across consumers.},

  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={164544-164555},
  abstract={In cloud storage, selectively sharing encrypted data is becoming increasingly important. One key design challenge is the management of encryption keys. Traditionally, a large quantity of encryption keys have to be managed by the data owner, and an equally large number of keyword trapdoors must be sent to the cloud for the purpose of searching over the shared data, which are cumbersome in terms of secure communication and management. Recently, key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes have been introduced to alleviate the problem. However, they were only designed under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman Exponent assumption in the prior works. Lattice-based key-aggregate (searchable) encryption schemes are valuable, because they have security against quantum computing attacks, average-case to worse-case equivalence as well as simplicity and potential efficiency. Here we propose a key-aggregate encryption scheme and a key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme which are both based on a lattice problem (i.e., the Learning with Errors problem). Some key techniques are employed during the construction of the schemes. A basis delegation algorithm is designed to generate the aggregate key without increasing the lattice dimension. The encryption algorithms of the two schemes are trickily devised to make the encrypted files decryptable or searchable. To overcome the problem of general matrix multiplication failing to satisfy commutative law, a hash function is designed by using diagonalizable matrices to make the encrypted file decryptable and the trapdoor adjustable. We present the schemes’ correctness proof, formal security analysis as well as performance analysis, which confirm that they are provably secure and practically efficient. To the best of our knowledge, the former is the first lattice-based key-aggregate encryption scheme and the latter is the first lattice-based key-aggregate searchable encryption scheme. We also demonstrate their application to cloud storage for searchable group data sharing by combining the two schemes.},

The advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing platform allows collecting data about the customers to carry out CCP. This paper introduces an optimal genetic algorithm (OGA) with support vector machine (SVM) model for CCP. Initially, the OGA is derived by the use of double chain-quantum-genetic-algorithm. Next, the derived OGA is applied for optimizing the parameters of SVM namely C and Υ. The outcome of the OGA-SVM model is tested against a benchmark dataset from telecom industry. The experimental outcome indicated that the OGA-SVM shows excellent results by offering better sensitivity of 94.50, specificity of 66.06, accuracy of 90.27, F-Score of 94.30 and kappa value of 61.17 correspondingly.},

  abstract={The Transient Public Key Infrastructure or T-PKI is introduced in this paper that allows a transactional approach to attestation, where a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) can stay anonymous to a verifier. In cloud computing and IoT environments, attestation is a critical step in ensuring that the environment is untampered with. With attestation, the verifier would be able to ascertain information about the TPM (such as location, or other system information) that one may not want to disclose. The addition of the Direct Anonymous Attestation added to TPM 2.0 would potentially solve this problem, but it uses the traditional RSA or ECC based methods. In this paper, a Lattice-based approach is used that is both quantum safe, and not dependent on creating a new key pair in order to increase anonymity.},

Fourth-gen (4G) internet communication is still in scaling period but 5G is been rolled out in few countries. Now with almost 8-billion people on planet, AI, ML, and other technologies are in greater demand. The search for 6G has already began and is thought to be deployed worldwide soon. With more & more research in this area, the speed of internet is ultra-fast and with 6thGen it will be even faster. The 6G will revolutionize the IT & Technology industry in less than a decade from now. Nevertheless, there are some underlying challenges that occur with more speed and need to be resolved before providing it to masses. The issues are higher losses for small distance, lower latency, more system capacity etc. This paper helps in understanding the goal of 6thGen wireless network communication in future and its network’s structure. Below we have described those new budding technologies like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, automated cars, block chain, three-dimensional networking, quantum communication, cloud computing, information transfer, remote access and analyzing big data that will help the 6G internet communication architecture development with the guaranteed transfer-rate we aim to achieve.

  abstract={Supporting artificial intelligence (AI) models training is one of the visions for future 6th generation (6G) networks. An extensive quantum of data and computational capabilities are necessitated for the training of AI models. However, with the development of AI models, it is evident that the existing edge computing network architectures are inadequate to meet the massive computing power and communication demands of distributed training for models with a growing number of parameters. In this paper, we propose a distributed training framework based on the edge-network-cloud architecture. Considering the architecture of the network and the computing capabilities of network nodes, the framework actively adapts the functional partitioning and allocation of data of the network nodes during the process of distributed training. Specifically, aggregation nodes are responsible for parameter aggregation and updating, while training nodes execute training tasks and transmit model gradients to the aggregation nodes asynchronously. To improve training efficiency and reduce communication time, we introduce a solution based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The algorithm intelligently allocates suitable data to nodes and selects node types by task-related information, thus accelerating distributed training across network nodes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively accelerates large-scale model training tasks.},

  abstract={Attribute-based encryption (ABE) mechanism on lattices can against quantum attack and guarantees fine-grained access control of encrypted data, and it has been widely used in cloud computing and privacy protection. However, the high complexity of the trapdoor generation and delegation and preimage sampling are the main barriers for the development of ABE schemes in a post-quantum world. Thus, we proposed a security and efficient multi-authority ABE scheme from lattices in this paper. The scheme is based on the theory of MP12 and is proved to be secure under the standard model. In this scheme, we construct an optimized sampling algorithm to generate a  $\mathbb {Z}_{q}$ -invertible matrix with a lower runtime. Based on it, combining the trapdoor generation and delegation algorithm in MP12, we designed multiple attribute authorities which can manage different attribute sets and generate private keys for the user independently. In addition, the Shamir’s secret sharing technique is introduced to support policies expressed in any monotone access structures. Compared with the existing related schemes, the proposed scheme can improve the functional agility and the flexibility of the access policy prominently, and it also can achieve a better performance with less lattice dimension, trapdoor storage occupation, and ciphertext expansion rate. The analysis shows that our scheme is feasible and superior in the large-scale distributed environment.},

In this scope, this paper puts together two emergent paradigms. On the one hand, the emergence of the Quantum Computation paradigm will allow these intensive systems to incorporate specific tasks that are unaffordable by classic computers. On the other hand, the liquid software model proposes a fluid movement of the software and information from one device to another. Therefore, in this paper, we present a broad overview of software-intensive systems from a liquid software perspective and support quantum functionalities in their processes.

  abstract={The rapid growth of IoT edge devices has caused in an unprecedented explosion of data volume. Extremely often, the created data is gathered and disseminated via edge-based IoT structures. When hostile IoT devices make requests to steal private data from a cloud storage system via edge nodes, the data-sharing privacy exposure issue becomes even more concerning. We provide evolutionary privacy protection learning algorithms for an IoT data sharing scheme based on edge computing as a solution to the stated problem. Deep learning of medical models in an IoT-based healthcare scheme is described here via a federated learning approach. Using a combination of the alternating quantum walk (AQW) and the Advanced encryption standard (AES), this research suggests a new method of picture encryption. A keystream generator associated with AQW limits is used to build a likelihood distribution matrix, and the study makes use of quantum features to enhance the AES algorithm. To unlock the AES method, we must first extract certain singular values from the matrix. Elements of the probability distribution matrix stand in for Rcon in the AES algorithm. The AES algorithm's S-box and ShiftRow transformation mapping rules are then jumbled based on the increasing size of the clone probability distribution matrix. The preprocessing is done with a likelihood distribution matrix and a plaintext XOR operation, and the encryption is done with a modified version of the AES algorithm. To prevent an adversary from concluding confidential medical data via assaults like a perfect reconstruction attack, etc., this encryption technique may be applied to better safeguard local models.},

  abstract={Lightweight devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) typically need to store massive data on a cloud server with strong processing and storage capabilities for later retrieval and usage. Since these data contain the participant’s sensitive information, they cannot be delivered directly to the cloud server. Public-key Encryption with Keyword Search (PEKS) allows customers to search for target encrypted files using keywords. However, the majority of PEKS implementations are unable to repel malicious quantum-capable attackers. And with regard to forward security, they must search for many rounds to obtain the necessary data. To resolve these concerns, we propose a comprehensive Inner Product Outsourcing PEKS system (IPO-PEKS) with forward security based on LWE assumptions, which raises search efficiency by allowing authorized clients to find the information they desire in a single round and achieves more fine-grained searches. Furthermore, we offer an inner product outsourcing calculation technique that allows the server to compute the inner product result without knowing the details of both parties in order to conceal the relevant privacy data of transmitting and decryption states. The paradigm can be utilized for efficient state transition through the use of parallel computing to accomplish the target of one round of iteration.},

  abstract={The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) applications in our daily lives has led to a surge in data traffic, posing significant security challenges. IoT applications using cloud and edge computing are at higher risk of cyberattacks because of the expanded attack surface from distributed edge and cloud services, the vulnerability of IoT devices, and challenges in managing security across interconnected systems leading to oversights. This led to the rise of ML-based solutions for intrusion detection systems (IDSs), which have proven effective in enhancing network security and defending against diverse threats. However, ML-based IDS in IoT systems encounters challenges, particularly from noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features in varied IoT datasets, potentially impacting its performance. Therefore, reducing such features becomes crucial to enhance system performance and minimize computational costs. This paper focuses on improving the effectiveness of ML-based IDS at the edge level by introducing a novel method to find a balanced trade-off between cost and accuracy through the creation of informative features in a two-tier edge-user IoT environment. A hybrid Binary Quantum-inspired Artificial Bee Colony and Genetic Programming algorithm is utilized for this purpose. Three IoT intrusion detection datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and BoT-IoT, are used for the evaluation of the proposed approach. Performance analysis is conducted using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and False Positive Rate (FPR) are employed, while the cost of the IDS system is assessed based on computational time. The results are compared with existing methods in the literature, revealing that the IDS performance can be enhanced with fewer features, consequently reducing computational time, through the proposed method. This offers a better performance-cost trade-off for the IDS system.},

  abstract={Edge Internet of Things (EIoT) involves computing at edge servers rather than at the cloud, thus primarily reducing latency and bandwidth issues. A traditional EIoT system often ignores the security issues that prevail due to power and computational limitations. Additionally, a hierarchical EIoT system essentially acts like a cloud system requiring security access to be given to a third party for data analysis. The concept of homomorphic encryption can be introduced in this scenario where computation can be done on encrypted data thus removing the need to give third-party access to sensitive data. A novel homomorphic encryption is proposed by enhancing the EIGamal algorithm with the capability of learning with errors to adapt it as a post-quantum cryptographic algorithm. This enhanced algorithm cannot be decrypted purely using the knowledge needed to decrypt the original algorithm, with the same key pair.},

  abstract={Cloud computing enables developers to deploy and host applications without focusing on installing and maintaining the infrastructure. The developers can utilize the services provided by the cloud service providers (CSPs) to offer scalable solutions to customer applications. As a result, CSPs are deluged with different batches of cloudlets (tasks) from diverse customer applications. Therefore, developing an algorithm that selects and processes applications intelligently to minimize the execution time and maximize the throughput becomes challenging. Many researchers have shown the round-robin (RR) scheduling algorithm variants to tackle this problem. One such variant is the dynamic RR heuristic algorithm (DRRHA) that utilizes the mean of the burst times (BTs) of cloudlets in the ready queue (RQ) to calculate the time quantum (TQ). However, DRRHA has not considered skewness. This paper introduces a novel skewness-based RR algorithm (SRRA) for cloudlet scheduling. The algorithm dynamically determines the TQ for each cloudlet based on the skewness of the BTs of cloudlets in the RQ. The algorithm has two variants: SRRA with minimum TQ (SRRA-Min) and SRRA with median TQ (SRRA-Med). The two variants of the proposed algorithm exhibit improved performance in terms of total execution time (TET) and throughput compared to DRRHA, individually and collectively. These comparisons are conducted using CloudSim Plus under two scenarios: constant skewness with varying cloudlets and constant cloudlets with varying skewness.},

  abstract={Recent developments in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enable interconnected vehicles to support ubiquitous services. Various emerging service applications are promising to increase the Quality of Experience (QoE) of users. On-board computation tasks generated by these applications have heavily overloaded the resource-constrained vehicles, forcing it to offload on-board tasks to other edge intelligence (EI)-assisted servers. However, excessive task offloading can lead to severe competition for communication and computation resources among vehicles, thereby increasing the processing latency, energy consumption, and system cost. To address these problems, we investigate the transmission-awareness and computing-sense uplink resource management problem and formulate it as a time-varying Markov decision process. Considering the total delay, energy consumption, and cost, quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed to develop an intelligence-oriented edge offloading strategy. Specifically, the vehicle can flexibly choose the network access mode and offloading strategy through two different radio interfaces to offload tasks to multiaccess edge computing (MEC) servers through WiFi and cloud servers through 5G. The objective of this joint optimization is to maintain a self-adaptive balance between these two aspects. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the transmission latency and computation delay.},

  year={2022},

  number={2},
  pages={2968-2978},
  abstract={The integrity auditing of outsourced data is becoming an essential process because an increasing number of people or organizations are opting to store health records in cloud servers to reduce local storage. Most existing public auditing schemes requiring complex certificate management are unsuitable for resource-limited mobile devices and are unable to resist quantum attacks; thus, we propose a lattice-based proxy-oriented public auditing scheme for electronic health records. We construct an identity-based auditing scheme based on the small integer solution to avoid complex certificate management issues. We also introduce the idea of proxy to reduce computing overhead from the user side significantly and enable the application of resource-limited mobile devices. Furthermore, we improve the proposed scheme by integrating the Ethereum blockchain to resist malicious proxies. We prove that the proposed scheme is proxy-protected, unforgeable, and privacy-protected. Results of an efficiency analysis show that our scheme demonstrates high computing efficiency on the user side and comprehensive functions.},

  abstract={In the digital era, the evolution of big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, and quantum computing demands a preferable networking infrastructure to handle network expansion and network usage optimally. In traditional Data Center Networks (DCNs), bundling of control and data plane in the same networking device limits its functionality for dynamic computation and storage access. The load balancing developed in traditional network infrastructure is not precise, as it is based on the local information of the network. Due to existing static routing mechanisms in traditional networks, most of the network resources are still underutilized. This dissipation of network assets is becoming common in today’s traditional typical networks. SDN emerges as a new platform that promises to control, change, and manage the inherent services of networking nodes by extracting statistics from lower layers of the network topology, facilitating network engineers and administrators. Load balancing in SDN offers a fair load share between network nodes, optimizing the best path along with bandwidth and reducing latency. SDN offers a global view of the whole network in one place, a centralized controller while helping in making satisfactory and upright decisions. In this paper, an SDN-based controller, Floodlight, is chosen for the implementation of dynamic load balancing. The Dijkstra’s algorithm is exercised in our application running on the controller. A data center network, FatTree topology of open flow switches, is deployed to depict the real-life traffic complexity in a data center network. To create a virtual topology of nodes, a Mininet emulation platform is utilized. Different load-balancing verification mechanisms validate that our load- balancing technique is doing a splendid piece of work.},

  abstract={The utilization of cell phones and desktop computers on a global scale has experienced a significant growth in recent years. This tendency has heightened global competition and demanded firms' regional development for their continued viability. For these criteria to be met, it is required to efficiently employ resources in pursuit of operational excellence. In the context of cloud computing (CC), task scheduling is a key research topic. Task scheduling is an approach that employs an efficient algorithm to map client tasks to appropriate and accessible virtualized resources. Since CC is a distributed and scalable realm, it is more difficult to schedule work. Therefore, an effective approach to work scheduling is required since it is regarded as vital for system performance. Traditional algorithms including round-robin (RR), first come first serve (FCFS), largest job first (LJF), and shortest job first (SJF). To enhance the RR algorithm, several researchers have concentrated on choosing a suitable quantum time and provided a variety of approaches. Several researchers use Cloudsim to model CC infrastructure and applications. This review is intended to explore further because there are still many problems that will be corrected and resolved in further research. This paper can be a valuable resource for researchers who want to improve or develop RR or implement it in CC or various other related fields.},

	abstract = {Despite the current progress in quantum computing, the reliability of quantum computers is very challenging. Near-term quantum computers referred to as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to operate in the presence of errors. To run a quantum circuit on a NISQ computer, the circuit should be mapped to satisfy the physical constraints of the quantum architecture. The mapping process takes into account the error rates of the quantum hardware. It selects physical qubits and their movements, which minimize the circuit error rates. The output of the quantum circuit can be obtained through several runs on NISQ computers.What's important from a security perspective is that the output of the quantum circuit is inherently dependent on the error parameters of the quantum hardware. An adversary can, therefore, leverage such dependency to alter the functional behavior of the quantum circuit. We show that malicious changes in the error rates used for mapping quantum circuits can change their output. To detect this attack on NISQ architectures, we propose inserting test points into the quantum circuits to study their error rates with respect to other qubit allocations. We utilize superposition, classical, and un-compute tests to provide side-channel information of the quantum circuit. We study the effectiveness of our approach using IBMQ 16 Melbourne quantum computer and Qiskit tools as an exemplar.},

The supporting quantum computing operation software also has a high professional threshold. These make it more difficult to deploy and use locally. Cloud based quantum computing services will play an important role in computing power in the quantum era. At present, high-quality quantum computing QPU is scarce, which brings access needs of a large number of users. The computing tasks of a single user are too large, resulting in a large number of resources being occupied by a single user for a period of time, affecting the use of other users or tasks. A new quantum computing cloud platform task scheduling scheme is proposed to classify users and tasks and provide differentiated service opportunities. This scheme will enable high priority users to reduce waiting time and get a better experience.},

This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC. Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches. This study illustrates the steps needed in order to be “quantum computer ready” in order to apply quantum computing to drug discovery and to provide the foundation on which to build this field.},

But the Quantum Internet is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Phenomena with no counterpart in classical networks, such as no-cloning, quantum measurement, entanglement and quantum teleportation, impose new challenging constraints for network design. Specifically, classical network functionalities are based on the assumption that classical information can be safely read and copied. However, this assumption does not hold in the Quantum Internet. As a consequence, its design requires a major network-paradigm shift to harness the quantum mechanics specificities. The goal of this work is to shed light on the challenges and open problems of Quantum Internet design. We first introduce some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics, needed to understand the differences between a classical and a quantum network. Then, we introduce quantum teleportation as the key strategy for transmitting quantum information without physically transferring the particle that stores the quantum information or violating the principles of quantum mechanics. Finally, the key research challenges to design quantum communication networks are discussed.},

	abstract = {With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing `Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.},

	doi = {https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.995},
	abstract = {Abstract Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein IT infrastructure and applications are provided as `services' to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efficient management of data center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application QoS requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

They start by introducing the Quantum Internet as the fundamental underlying infrastructure of the distributed quantum computing ecosystem. Then they go further, by elaborating on a high-level system abstraction of the distributed quantum computing ecosystem. They describe such an abstraction through a set of logical layers. Thereby, they clarify dependencies among the aforementioned layers and, at the same time, a road-map emerges.},

	abstract = {Existing and near-term quantum computers face significant reliability challenges because of high error rates caused by noise. Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) model of computing. As NISQ machines exhibit high error-rates, only programs that require a few qubits can be executed reliably. Therefore, NISQ machines tend to underutilize its resources. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput and utilization of NISQ machines by using multi-programming and enabling the NISQ machine to concurrently execute multiple workloads.Multi-programming a NISQ machine is non-trivial. This is because, a multi-programmed NISQ machine can have an adverse impact on the reliability of the individual workloads. To enable multi-programming in a robust manner, we propose three solutions. First, we develop methods to partition the qubits into multiple reliable regions using error information from machine calibration so that each program can have a fair allocation of reliable qubits. Second, we observe that when two programs are of unequal lengths, measurement operations can impact the reliability of the co-running program. To reduce this interference, we propose a Delayed Instruction Scheduling (DIS) policy that delays the start of the shorter program so that all the measurement operations can be performed at the end. Third, we develop an Adaptive Multi-Programming (AMP) design that monitors the reliability at runtime and reverts to single program mode if the reliability impact of multi-programming is greater than a predefined threshold. Our evaluations with IBM-Q16 show that our proposals can improve resource utilization and throughput by up to 2x, while limiting the impact on reliability.},

Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined with extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this technology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated my many, some of the first realizations of quantum computing technology has occured over the cloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet. Recently, IBM has released the Quantum Experience, which allows users to access a five-qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this online availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum information experiments. We utilize the IBM chip to realize protocols in quantum error correction, quantum arithmetic, quantum graph theory, and fault-tolerant quantum computation by accessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject to significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This demonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a wider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology.},

Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already used by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the space complexity of the classical decryption function – which aligns well with the current efforts to minimize the complexity of the decryption function.},

These quantum primitive protocols can ensure information-theoretical security and provide long-term security, which are guaranteed by the principles of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we present a grouping strategy to improve the communication efficiency of multiparty quantum protocols. In addition, we investigate privacy-preserving applications of these quantum primitive protocols in cloud-based environments, e.g., cloud-based Anonymous Voting and Multiparty Private Set Intersection.

With the joint effort of national governments, industrial participants, and research institutes, the development of quantum networks has advanced rapidly in recent years, bringing the first primitive quantum networks within reach. In this work, we aim to provide an up-to-date review of the field of quantum networks from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, contributing to a better understanding of the building blocks required for the establishment of a global quantum internet. We also introduce a newly developed quantum network toolkit to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of innovative ideas. Particularly, it provides dual quantum computing engines, supporting simulations in both the quantum circuit and measurement-based models. It also includes a compilation scheme for mapping quantum network protocols onto quantum circuits, enabling their emulations on real-world quantum hardware devices. We showcase the power of this toolkit with several featured demonstrations, including a simulation of the Micius quantum satellite experiment, a testing of a four-layer quantum network architecture with resource management, and a quantum emulation of the CHSH game.

NISQ devices, such as the IBM Q Experience, have very recently proven their capability as experimental platforms accessible to everyone around the globe. Until now, IBM Q Experience processors have mostly been used for quantum computation and simulation of closed systems. Here, we show that these devices are also able to implement a great variety of paradigmatic open quantum systems models, hence providing a robust and flexible testbed for open quantum systems theory. During the last decade an increasing number of experiments have successfully tackled the task of simulating open quantum systems in different platforms, from linear optics to trapped ions, from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to cavity quantum electrodynamics. Generally, each individual experiment demonstrates a specific open quantum system model, or at most a specific class. Our main result is to prove the great versatility of the IBM Q Experience processors. Indeed, we experimentally implement one and two-qubit open quantum systems, both unital and non-unital dynamics, Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. Moreover, we realise proof-of-principle reservoir engineering for entangled state generation, demonstrate collisional models, and verify revivals of quantum channel capacity and extractable work, caused by memory effects. All these results are obtained using IBM Q Experience processors publicly available and remotely accessible online.},

Legal and ethical requirements may prevent the use of cloud-based machine learning solutions for such tasks.

This allows a data owner to send their data in an encrypted form to a cloud service that hosts the network. The encryption ensures that the data remains confidential since the cloud does not have access to the keys needed to decrypt it. Nevertheless, we will show that the cloud service is capable of applying the neural network to the encrypted data to make encrypted predictions, and also return them in encrypted form. These encrypted predictions can be sent back to the owner of the secret key who can decrypt them. Therefore, the cloud service does not gain any information about the raw data nor about the prediction it made. We demonstrate CryptoNets on the MNIST optical character recognition tasks. CryptoNets achieve 99\% accuracy and can make around 59000 predictions per hour on a single PC. Therefore, they allow high throughput, accurate, and private predictions.},

	abstract = {Quantum k-means algorithm is widely used in solving clustering problems. However, the repeated calculation of the core subroutines overloads the quantum computer with mass computing tasks. In addition, due to the decoherence of the quantum state, the computing power of personal quantum computer is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to use high-performance quantum cloud computing to complete data processing. This paper proposes a quantum k-means algorithm in quantum cloud computing, which uploads the data to the server to execute the core subroutines SwapT est (calculating the similarity between ciphertext quantum states) and Gr over O ptim (quantum minimization algorithm) of quantum k-means algorithm and then sends the ciphertext to the client for further decryption using the decryption key, which reduces the load of the client. An improved quantum homomorphic encryption by t-gate updating in trusted server and data processing in semi-trusted server is introduced as well. In this scheme, the trusted server assists the semi-trusted server to execute the T -gate existing in the quantum circuit, which separates the key from the ciphertext and ensure the security of the ciphertext data processing in the quantum cloud. In our experiment, the two subroutines, SwapT est and Gr over O ptim, are conducted in ciphertext and plaintext conditions by using IBM Qiskit to evaluate the reliability and feasibility. The result shows that the decrypted ciphertext result is the same as the plaintext. We conclude that the proposed algorithm has a better performance in reducing the cost of load in client and protecting privacy data in cloud by contrast with the original quantum k-means algorithm.},

	abstract = {Summary The new era of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to entangle the relationships among models (characterizations), algorithms, and implementations toward the high-level intelligence with general cognitive ability, strong robustness, and interpretability, which is intractable for machine learning (ML). Quantum computer provides a new computing paradigm for ML. Although universal quantum computers are still in infancy, special-purpose D-Wave machine hopefully becomes the breaking point of commercialized quantum computing. The core principle, quantum annealing (QA), enables the quantum system to naturally evolve toward the low-energy states. D-Wave's quantum computer has developed some applications of quantum ML based on quantum-assisted ML algorithms, quantum Boltzmann machine, etc. Additionally, working with CPUs, quantum processing units is likely to advance ML in a quantum-inspired way. Thus, a new advanced computing architecture, quantum-classical hybrid approach consisting of QA, classical computing, and brain-inspired cognitive science, is required to explore its superiority to universal quantum algorithms and classical ML algorithms. It is important to explore hybrid quantum/classical approaches to overcome the defects of ML such as high dependence on training data, low robustness to the noises, and cognitive impairment.

Quantum random number generation based on various quantum principles has been proposed to provide true randomness in the last two decades. We integrate four different types of quantum random number generators on the Alibaba Cloud servers to enhance cybersecurity. Post-processing modules are integrated into the quantum platform to extract true random numbers. We employ improved authentication protocols where original pseudo-random numbers are replaced with quantum ones. Users from the Alibaba Cloud, such as Ant Financial and Smart Access Gateway, request random numbers from the quantum platform for various cryptographic tasks. For cloud services demanding the highest security, such as Alipay at Ant Financial, we combine the random numbers from four quantum devices by XOR the outputs to enhance practical security.

	abstract = {Classical Internet evolved exceptionally during the last five decades, from a network comprising a few static nodes in the early days to a leviathan interconnecting billions of devices. This has been possible by the separation of concern principle, for which the network functionalities are organized as a stack of layers, each providing some communication functionalities through specific network protocols. In this survey, we aim at highlighting the impossibility of adapting the classical Internet protocol stack to the Quantum Internet, due to the marvels of quantum mechanics. Indeed, the design of the Quantum Internet requires a major paradigm shift of the whole protocol stack for harnessing the peculiarities of quantum entanglement and quantum information. In this context, we first overview the relevant literature about Quantum Internet protocol stack. Then, stemming from this, we sheds the light on the open problems and required efforts toward the design of an effective and complete Quantum Internet protocol stack. To the best of authors' knowledge, a survey of this type is the first of its own. What emerges from this analysis is that the Quantum Internet, though still in its infancy, is a disruptive technology whose design requires an inter-disciplinary effort at the border between quantum physics, computer and telecommunications engineering.},

With the rapid advancement and proliferation of quantum computing research worldwide, there has been a considerable increase in demand for using cloud-based quantum computation resources. This demand has highlighted the need for designing efficient and adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum computing. However, the limited quantity, quality, and accessibility of quantum resources pose significant challenges to practical research in quantum software and systems. To address these challenges, we propose iQuantum, a first-of-its-kind simulation toolkit that can model quantum computing environments for prototyping and evaluating system design and scheduling algorithms. This paper presents the quantum computing system model, architectural design, proof-of-concept implementation, potential use cases, and future development of iQuantum. Our proposed iQuantum simulator is anticipated to boost research in quantum software and systems, particularly in the creation and evaluation of policies and algorithms for resource management, job scheduling, and hybrid quantum-classical task orchestration in quantum computing environments integrating edge and cloud resources.},

	abstract = {The growing popularity of cloud-based machine learning raises natural questions about the privacy guarantees that can be provided in such settings. Our work tackles this problem in the context of prediction-as-a-service wherein a server has a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on its private data and wishes to provide classifications on clients' private images. Our goal is to build efficient secure computation protocols which allow a client to obtain the classification result without revealing their input to the server, while at the same preserving the privacy of the server's neural network.To this end, we design Gazelle, a scalable and low-latency system for secure neural network inference, using an intricate combination of homomorphic encryption and traditional two-party computation techniques (such as garbled circuits). Gazelle makes three contributions. First, we design a homomorphic encryption library which provides fast implementations of basic homomorphic operations such as SIMD (single instruction multiple data) addition, SIMD multiplication and ciphertext slot permutation. Second, we implement homomorphic linear algebra kernels which provide fast algorithms that map neural network layers to optimized homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication and convolution routines. Third, we design optimized encryption switching protocols which seamlessly convert between homomorphic and garbled circuit encodings to enable implementation of complete neural network inference.We evaluate our protocols on benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and show that Gazelle outperforms the best existing systems such as MiniONN (ACM CCS 2017) and Chameleon (Crypto Eprint 2017/1164) by 20-30× in online runtime. When compared with fully homomorphic approaches like CryptoNets (ICML 2016), we demonstrate three orders of magnitude faster online run-time.},

The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.},

Quantum True Random Number Generator (QTRNG) can yield real random data to replace random-looking periodic sequences. Here, we present the fastest QTRNG on factual Quantum Computational Devices (QCD) locally on our device to save time. To construct a random number generator, the IBM Q Experience called Qiskit is used. The ease of our source Hadamard gate pooled with its verifiably sole randomness is imperative for attaining quantum random number generators at no cost. The inner matrix product of the square of the Hadamard gate is proved to be identified in the quantum lab. Applying the H gate twice on the quantum register cancelled out the H gate pair. It acted as a single Hadamard gate that was practically visualised using the IMB Q experience. The 24-qubit random number is experimented with and investigated in this work. The min-entropy of such generated random numbers is 0.0007244 with the worst-case entropy value of 0.999507. Besides, subsequent verification of genuine randomness was confirmed by steering restart experimentation, \& the statistical properties of TRNG were evaluated over autocorrelation study, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-90B \& 800-22 tests.},

To solve this problem, we propose a scheme based on the quantum computer which is motivated by the source-independent QRNG scheme in optics. By using a method to estimate the upper bound of the superposition state preparation error, the scheme can provide certified randomness in the presence of readout errors. To increase the generation rate of random bits, we also provide a parameter optimization method with a finite data size.

The development of quantum electronics has led to the practical achievement of quantum devices that are already available on the market and waiting for their first application on a broader scale. A major aspect of quantum cryptography is the methodology of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is used to generate and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically separate users using the principles of quantum physics. In previous years, several successful QKD networks have been created to test the implementation and interoperability of different practical solutions. This article surveys previously applied methods, showing techniques for deploying QKD networks and current challenges of QKD networking. Unlike studies focusing on optical channels and optical equipment, this survey focuses on the network aspect by considering network organization, routing and signaling protocols, simulation techniques, and a software-defined QKD networking approach.},

	abstract = {The development that quantum computing technologies are achieving is beginning to attract the interest of companies that could potentially be users of quantum software. Thus, it is perfectly feasible that during the next few years hybrid systems will start to appear integrating both the classical software systems of companies and new quantum ones providing solutions to problems that still remain unmanageable today. A natural way to support such integration is Service-Oriented Computing. While conceptually the invocation of a quantum software service is similar to that of a classical one, technically there are many differences and technological limitations, which refer to platform independence, decoupling, scalability, etc. To highlight these differences and the difficulties to develop quality quantum services, this paper takes a well-known problem to which a quantum solution can be provided, integer factorization, making use of the Amazon Braket quantum service platform. The exercise of trying to provide the factorization as a quantum service is carried out following the best practices, design patterns and standards existing in the implementation of classical services. This case study is used to highlight the rough edges and limitations that arise in the integration of classical-quantum hybrid systems using service-oriented computing. The conclusion of the study allows us to point out directions in which to focus research efforts in order to achieve effective quantum service-oriented computing.},

	abstract = {With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics, quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks. However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is performed on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware in the short term. Only small circuits can be executed reliably on a quantum machine due to the unavoidable noisy quantum operations on NISQ devices, leading to the under-utilization of hardware resources. With the growing demand to access quantum hardware, how to utilize it more efficiently while maintaining output fidelity is becoming a timely issue. A parallel circuit execution technique has been proposed to address this problem by executing multiple programs on hardware simultaneously. It can improve the hardware throughput and reduce the overall runtime. However, accumulative noises such as crosstalk can decrease the output fidelity in parallel workload execution. In this paper, we first give an in-depth overview of state-of-the-art parallel circuit execution methods. Second, we propose a Quantum Crosstalk-aware Parallel workload execution method (QuCP) without the overhead of crosstalk characterization. Third, we investigate the trade-off between hardware throughput and fidelity loss to explore the hardware limitation with parallel circuit execution. Finally, we apply parallel circuit execution to VQE and zero-noise extrapolation error mitigation method to showcase its various applications on advancing NISQ computing.},

However, the crosstalk, unwanted interference between qubits on NISQ processors, may cause performance degradation when using multiprogramming. To address this challenge, we introduce palloq (parallel allocation of QCs), a novel compilation protocol. Palloq improves the performance of quantum multiprogramming on NISQ processors, while paying attention to 1) the combination of QCs chosen for parallel execution and 2) the assignment of program qubit variables to physical qubits, to reduce unwanted interference among the active set of QCs. We also propose a software-based crosstalk detection protocol using a new combination of randomized benchmarking methods. Our method successfully characterizes the suitability of hardware for multiprogramming with relatively low detection costs. We found a tradeoff between the success rate and execution time of the multiprogramming. Our results will be of value when device throughput becomes a significant bottleneck. Until service providers have enough quantum processors available to more than meet demand, this approach will be attractive to the service providers and users who want to optimize job management and throughput of the processor.},

	abstract = {Qubit mapping for NISQ superconducting quantum computers is essential to fidelity and resource utilization. The existing qubit mapping schemes meet challenges, e.g., crosstalk, SWAP overheads, diverse device topologies, etc., leading to qubit resource underutilization and low fidelity in computing results. This paper introduces QuCloud+, a new qubit mapping scheme that tackles these challenges. QuCloud+ has several new designs. (1) QuCloud+ supports single/multi-programming quantum computing on quantum chips with 2D/3D topology. (2) QuCloud+ partitions physical qubits for concurrent quantum programs with the crosstalk-aware community detection technique and further allocates qubits according to qubit degree, improving fidelity and resource utilization. (3) QuCloud+ includes an X-SWAP mechanism that avoids SWAPs with high crosstalk errors and enables inter-program SWAPs to reduce the SWAP overheads. (4) QuCloud+ schedules concurrent quantum programs to be mapped and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice. Experimental results show that, compared with the existing typical multi-programming study\&nbsp;[12], QuCloud+ achieves up to 9.03\% higher fidelity and saves on the required SWAPs during mapping, reducing the number of CNOT gates inserted by 40.92\%. Compared with a recent study\&nbsp;[30] that enables post-mapping gate optimizations to further reduce gates, QuCloud+ reduces the post-mapping circuit depth by 21.91\% while using a similar number of gates.},

While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period, encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion “shots” or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.},

Although some quantum algorithms already exist that show a theoretical speedup compared to the best known classical algorithms, the implementation and execution of these algorithms come with several challenges. The input data determines, for example, the required number of qubits and gates of a quantum algorithm. A quantum algorithm implementation also depends on the used Software Development Kit which restricts the set of usable quantum computers. Because of the limited capabilities of current quantum computers, choosing an appropriate one to execute a certain implementation for a given input is a difficult challenge that requires immense mathematical knowledge about the implemented quantum algorithm as well as technical knowledge about the used Software Development Kits. In this paper, we present a concept for the automated analysis and selection of implementations of quantum algorithms and appropriate quantum computers that can execute a selected implementation with a certain input data. The practical feasibility of the concept is demonstrated by the prototypical implementation of a tool that we call NISQ Analyzer.},

In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.},

The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions.

Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks. We also analyse existing works discussing aspects of serverless resource management using this taxonomy.

Classical Internet has laid its foundation originating from the amalgamation of mathematics and Claude Shannon's theory of information. However, today's Internet technology is a playground for eavesdroppers. This poses a serious challenge to various applications that rely on classical Internet technology, and it has motivated the researchers to switch to new technologies that are fundamentally more secure. By exploring the quantum effects, researchers paved the way into quantum networks that provide security, privacy, and range of capabilities such as quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The realization of Quantum Internet (QI) requires quantum communication between various remote nodes through quantum channels guarded by quantum cryptographic protocols. Such networks rely upon quantum bits (qubits) that can simultaneously take the value of zeros and ones. Due to the extraordinary properties of qubits such as superposition, entanglement, and teleportation, it gives an edge to quantum networks over traditional networks in many ways. At the same time, transmitting qubits over long distances is a formidable task and extensive research is going on satellite-based quantum communication, which will deliver breakthroughs for physically realizing QI in near future. In this paper, QI functionalities, technologies, applications and open challenges have been extensively surveyed to help readers gain a basic understanding of the infrastructure required for the development of the global QI.},

Several third-party compilers are improving the compilation times and depth/gate counts. Untrusted third parties or a particular version of a trusted compiler may allow an attacker to steal, clone, and/or reverse engineer the quantum circuit. We propose to obfuscate quantum circuits by employing dummy CNOT gates to prevent such threats. If the adversary clones the obfuscated design, he/she will get faulty results. We propose a metric-based dummy gate insertion process to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD) and validated using IBM's noisy simulators. Our metric guided dummy gate insertion process achieves TVD of up to 28.83\%, and performs 10.14\% better than the average TVD and performs within 12.45\% of the best obtainable TVD for the test benchmarks. The removal of dummy gates by the designer post-compilation to restore functionality as well as other finer details have been addressed.},

The set of quantum circuits that can be reliably run on NISQ devices is limited by their noisy operations and low qubit counts.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are next-generation devices that hold promise to perform calculations beyond the reach of classical computers. A leading method towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such, QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs, covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum autoencoders, as the quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context, we explore their intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences. We further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges and further research directions for QGLMs.},

We propose a speed benchmark, using an update to the quantum volume experiments that allows the measurement of Circuit Layer Operations Per Second (CLOPS) and identify how both classical and quantum components play a role in improving performance. We prescribe a procedure for measuring CLOPS and use it to characterize the performance of some IBM Quantum systems.},

	abstract = {Security has always been a critical issue in machine learning (ML) applications. Due to the high cost of model training – such as collecting relevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power – model-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important issues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning (QML) model-stealing attack also exists and is even more severe because the traditional encryption method, such as homomorphic encryption can hardly be directly applied to quantum computation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources, the monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones in the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a third-party company can be delegated to a quantum cloud provider as a service to be used by ordinary users. In this case, the QML model is likely to be leaked if the cloud provider is under attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely QuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms, we propose to divide the complete QML model into multiple parts and distribute them to multiple physically isolated quantum cloud providers for execution. As such, even if the adversary in a single provider can obtain a partial model, it does not have sufficient information to retrieve the complete model. Although promising, we observed that an arbitrary model design under distributed settings cannot provide model security. We further developed a reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically optimize the model design under the distributed setting, such that a good trade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental results on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can achieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search under centralized settings while providing the highest security than the baselines.},

	abstract = {With the slowing of Moore's law and decline of Dennard scaling, computing systems increasingly rely on specialized hardware accelerators in addition to general-purpose compute units. Increased hardware heterogeneity necessitates disaggregating applications into workflows of fine-grained tasks that run on a diverse set of CPUs and accelerators. Current accelerator delivery models cannot support such applications efficiently, as (1) the overhead of managing accelerators erases performance benefits for fine-grained tasks; (2) exclusive accelerator use per task leads to underutilization; and (3) specialization increases complexity for developers.We propose adopting concepts from Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which has solved these challenges for general-purpose CPUs in cloud computing. Kernel-as-a-Service (KaaS) is a novel serverless programming model for generic compute accelerators that aids heterogeneous workflows by combining the ease-of-use of higher-level abstractions with the performance of low-level hand-tuned code. We evaluate KaaS with a focus on the breadth of the idea and its generality to diverse architectures rather than on an in-depth implementation for a single accelerator. Using proof-of-concept prototypes, we show that this programming model provides performance, performance efficiency, and ease-of-use benefits across a diverse range of compute accelerators. Despite increased levels of abstraction, when compared to a naive accelerator implementation, KaaS reduces completion times for fine-grained tasks by up to 96.0\% (GPU), 68.4\% (FPGA), 98.6\% (TPU), and 34.9\% (QPU) in our experiments.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way we solve complex problems in various fields. Its unique features, such as superposition and entanglement, allow for speedup in certain computations compared to classical computers. In this paper, we show that incorporating quantum computing into a heterogeneous computation architecture is possible and potentially can greatly enhance the overall performance and efficiency of solving a wide range of problems. We propose a heterogeneous computation architecture that integrates quantum computing and classical computing. We describe how this architecture can be implemented using widely available opensource software and provide a reference implementation. We also discuss potential benefits and challenges. Our goal is to highlight the importance of seamless inclusion of quantum computing in the future of computation and how it can be achieved with tools we already have.},

	abstract = {Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms1,2. Present-day photonic quantum computers3–7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {Summary Quantum computing resources are predominantly accessible through cloud services, with a potential future shift to edge networks. This paradigm and the increasing global interest in quantum computing have amplified the need for efficient, adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum systems. However, many limitations in the quantum resources' quantity, quality, availability, and cost pose significant challenges for conducting research in practical environments. To address these challenges, we proposed iQuantum, a holistic and lightweight discrete-event simulation toolkit uniquely tailored to model hybrid quantum computing environments. We also present a detailed system model for prototyping and problem formulation in quantum resource management. Through rigorous empirical validation and evaluations using large-scale quantum workload datasets, we demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of our toolkit in various use cases. iQuantum provides a versatile environment for designing and evaluating quantum resource management policies such as quantum task scheduling, backend selection, hybrid task offloading, and orchestration in the quantum cloud-edge continuum. Our work endeavors to create substantial contributions to quantum computing modeling and simulation, empowering the creation of future resource management strategies and quantum computing's broader applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing is a new paradigm for solving problems that classical computers cannot reach. To the point that it is already generating interest in the scientific and industrial communities. Currently, quantum computers and technology are being developed to support the execution of quantum software. Several large computer companies have already built functional quantum computers, and developed several programming languages and quantum simulators that can be used by the general public. All this infrastructure for quantum computing is offered to quantum developers through the cloud, following a model similar to the familiar Infrastructure as a Service. However, due to the early stages of quantum computing taking advantage of the capabilities of these computers requires a very in depth knowledge of quantum programming and quantum hardware that is far from what cloud developers are used to in classical cloud offerings. Although the future of quantum computing is still unknown, it is highly certain that there must be a time when quantum computing coexists with classical computing. At the same time, one of the most well-known and tested solutions for the communication of heterogeneous computing systems are web services. In this tutorial we will offer an introductory view on how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, how this web services can be deployed, using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing, and invoked through classical web services endpoints. Finally, we will propose a way in which a disadvantage of current quantum computers in terms of web services can be transformed into an advantage for web services through the use of a Quantum API Gateway.},

This tutorial will provide an overview of how quantum algorithms can be converted into web services, and how they can be deployed using the Amazon Braket platform for quantum computing and invoked through classical web service endpoints.

Although still in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum regime, quantum computers hold promise to be able to execute novel algorithms and create invaluable data. However, just as with any other type of computing resource, they may be vulnerable to security attacks and should have defenses built into their design. This paper explores a particular threat of untrusted cloud providers, and how to protect user's quantum programs and data from the untrusted cloud provider. By leveraging trusted hardware in the quantum computer, a new obfuscation-based protection is developed based on switching of control pulses between different drive and control channels of the quantum computer. This work demonstrates that simple hardware modifications can enable dynamic, run-time pulse switching, which makes it extremely difficult for the cloud provider to decode what actual circuit is executed on the quantum computer. This work presents a basic architecture that employs pulse switching, and an extended architecture that includes use of dummy qubits for increased protection. The overhead of the proposed changes, as well as attack complexity for different types of user circuits and obfuscation levels is evaluated in this work.},

In this work, a high performance Grover algorithm simulation is proposed combining the characteristics of Grover's algorithm and the parallelism of cloud computing, which dramatically improves the performance of the load balancing among multi-core, the utilization of memory space and the efficiency of simulation. Moreover, We propose five different computing configurations in the cloud environment suitable for quantum simulation and compare them through experimentation. We also validate the effectiveness of optimization by analysis and experimentation. The experimentation shows the simulation can reach 31 bits depending on the scale of current configuration.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has entered its mature life thanks to the availability of cloud-based Noisy Intermediate -Scale Quantum (NISQ) technologies. These devices allow quantum researchers and practitioners to design, develop and test quantum algorithms on actual hardware, paving the way toward new approaches in solving problems intractable by classical computers. However, in spite of these achievements in quantum technologies, the size of the problems that can be actually solved by quantum algorithms is still limited by the small number of qubits and the considerable noise in computation that still characterizes NISQ devices. As a consequence, there is a strong need of introducing innovative computing architectures able to interconnect a set of NISQ devices to increase the capabilities of current quantum computers of solving hard problems in a reliable way. In this paper, the concept of Distributed Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (D-NISQ) is introduced as a reference computational model by which designing innovative frameworks where quantum devices interact to solve a complex problem by working cooperatively. In detail, the D-NISQ model consists of a hybrid and hierarchical architecture where classical and quantum processors interact to iteratively split up a problem into a collection of sub-problems, solve each one of them by means of a proper quantum algorithm, and fuse output quantum information so as to compute the final solution to the problem posed. As demonstrated by two case studies based on the well-known Grover's algorithm, a multi-threaded implementation of the D-NISQ reference model allows for greater reliability in solving problems by quantum computation.},

With such growth in Smart Cities, data volume and diversity increase due to Internet of Things (IoT) sensors in devices.

To address these risks, Smart Cities utilize Intelligent Operations Centers (IOCs) equipped with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. These algorithms continuously monitor and protect against security incidents. Although Quantum Computing (QC) has shown promise in Smart City applications, its usage as a service is still in the early stages. In this paper, we propose to investigate the utilization of Quantum as a Service (QaaS) to develop an architecture for securing a Smart City. Our approach employs Quantum Classifiers, QBoost from D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud and Variational Quantum Classifier, and PegaSoS Quantum Support Vector Classifier from IBM Quantum Services. These provide real-time data classification and a user-friendly dashboard to display security incidents in the Smart City. Among the three quantum classifiers considered for the proposed architecture, QBoost performed the best both regarding quality and processing time.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are currently accessible through a cloud-based platform that allows users to run their programs on a suite of quantum hardware. As the quantum computing ecosystem grows in popularity and utility, it is reasonable to expect more companies, including untrustworthy/untrustworthy/unreliable vendors, to begin offering quantum computers as hardware-as-a-service at various price/performance points. Since computing time on quantum hardware is expensive and the access queue may be long, users will be enticed to use less expensive but less reliable/trustworthy hardware. Less-trusted vendors may tamper with the results and/or parameters of quantum circuits, providing the user with a sub-optimal solution or incurring a cost of higher iterations. In this paper, we model and simulate adversarial tampering of input parameters and measurement outcomes on an exemplary hybrid quantum classical algorithm namely, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). We observe a maximum performance degradation of . To achieve comparable performance with minimal parameter tampering, the user incurs a minimum cost of 20X higher iteration. We propose distributing the computation (iterations) equally among the various hardware options to ensure trustworthy computing for a mix of trusted and untrusted hardware. In the chosen performance metrics, we observe a maximum improvement of ≈ 30\%. In addition, we propose re-initialization of the parameters after a few initial iterations to fully recover the original program performance and an intelligent run adaptive split heuristic, which allows users to identify tampered/untrustworthy hardware at runtime and allocate more iterations to the reliable hardware, resulting in a maximum improvement of ≈ .},

Nevertheless, the rapid surge in demand for cloud-based quantum computing resources has led to a scarcity, which in turn hampers users from achieving optimal satisfaction. Therefore, cloud quantum computing service providers require a unified analysis and scheduling framework for their quantum resources and user jobs to meet the ever-growing usage demands. This paper introduces a new multi-programming scheduling framework for quantum computing in a cloud environment. The framework addresses the issue of limited quantum computing resources in cloud environments and ensures a satisfactory user experience. It introduces three innovative designs: 1) Our framework automatically allocates tasks to different quantum backends while ensuring fairness among users by considering both the cloud-based quantum resources and the user-submitted tasks. 2) Multi-programming mechanism is employed across different quantum backends to enhance the overall throughput of the quantum cloud. In comparison to conventional task schedulers, our proposed framework achieves a throughput improvement of more than two-fold in the quantum cloud. 3) The framework can balance fidelity and user waiting time by adaptively adjusting scheduling parameters. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

However, as the quantum computing ecosystem expands, it introduces a unique set of challenges for developers and researchers. One of the main challenges facing developers in the quantum field is the great diversity of quantum service providers. Each of these service providers has different ways of managing the execution tasks and returning the results, which is a problem when trying to execute the same circuit in different providers. In response to this, we present an approach to the management of quantum web services in the cloud, following web engineering techniques. This solution uses load balancing and resource allocation techniques to improve the execution of quantum tasks across multiple providers. The proposal is based on a Quantum Load Balancer that dynamically allocates tasks to the most suitable provider based on availability, performance, and cost. In addition, a Task Manager is introduced that integrates the balancer with a resource manager and a quantum task scheduler to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. The proposal is evaluated through a set of experiments on real quantum hardware and simulators from different quantum service providers, such as Amazon Braket and IBM Quantum. The evaluation results demonstrate a significant average reduction in response times, with an average reduction of 31.6\% when the load balancer is employed. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

However, the integration of a complex QC platform in an HPC infrastructure poses several challenges, such as operation stability in non-laboratory like environments, and scarce access for maintenance. Currently, only a few fully-assembled QCs currently exist worldwide, employing highly heterogeneous and cutting-edge technologies. These platforms are mostly used for research purposes, and often bear closer resemblance to laboratory assemblies rather than production-ready, stable, and consistently-performing turnkey machines. Moreover, public cloud services with access to such quantum computers are scarce and their availability is generally limited to few days per week. In November 2022, we introduced the first cloud-accessible general-purpose quantum computer based on single photons. One of the key objectives was to maintain the platform's availability as high as possible while anticipating seamless compatibility with HPC hosting environment. In this article, we describe the design and implementation of our cloud-accessible quantum computing platform, and demonstrate one nine availability (92\%) for external users during a six-month period, higher than most online services.

	abstract = {Quantum computing (QC) is an emerging area that yearly improves and develops more advances in the number of qubits and the available infrastructure for public users. Nowadays, the main cloud service providers (CSP) are implementing different mechanisms to support access to their quantum computers, which can be used to perform small experiments, test hybrid algorithms and prove quantum theories. Recent research work have discussed the low capacity of using quantum computers in a single CSP to perform quantum computation that are needed to solve different experiments for real world problems. Thus, there are needs for computing powers in the form of qubits from multi-cloud environment. Quantum computing in a multi-cloud environment requires security of the communicating channels. A well known algorithm in quantum cryptography for this purpose is the quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol. This enables the sender and receiver of a message to know when a third party eavesdropped any data from the insecure quantum channel. To address the low capacity issue, this research develops and tests the use of heterogeneous quantum computers located on different CSP to distribute quantum calculations between them by leveraging the channel security provided by the QKD protocol. The achieved results show over 88.1\% of correct distributed quantum computation results without error correction methods, 96.8\% of correct distributed quantum computation results using error correction methods and over 98.8\% correct authorisation detection in multi-cloud environments. This demonstrates that quantum calculations can be distributed between different CSP while securing the channel with the QKD protocol at the same time. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Context: The emergence of quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. The ability of quantum computers to scale computations beyond what the current computers are capable of implies better performance and efficiency for certain algorithmic tasks. Objective: However, to benefit from such improvement, quantum computers must be integrated with existing software systems, a process that is not straightforward. In this paper, we propose a unified execution model that addresses the challenges that emerge from building hybrid classical-quantum applications at scale. Method: Following the Design Science Research methodology, we proposed a convention for mapping quantum resources and artifacts to Kubernetes concepts. Then, in an experimental Kubernetes cluster, we conducted experiments for scheduling and executing quantum tasks on both quantum simulators and hardware. Results: The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed platform Qubernetes (or Kubernetes for quantum) exposes the quantum computation tasks and hardware capabilities following established cloud-native principles, allowing seamless integration into the larger Kubernetes ecosystem. Conclusion: The quantum computing potential cannot be realized without seamless integration into classical computing. By validating that it is practical to execute quantum tasks in a Kubernetes infrastructure, we pave the way for leveraging the existing Kubernetes ecosystem as an enabler for hybrid classical-quantum computing. © 2024 The Author(s)},

However, it poses a high risk of data leakage in quantum machine learning (QML). To run a QML model with QaaS, users need to locally compile their quantum circuits including the sub circuit of data encoding first and then send the compiled circuit to the QaaS provider for execution. If the QaaS provider is untrustworthy, the subcircuit to encode the raw data can be easily stolen. Therefore, we propose a co-design framework for Preserving the data security of QML with the QaaS paradigm, namely PristiQ. By introducing an encryption subcircuit with extra secure qubits associated with a user-defined security key, the security of data can be greatly enhanced. And an automatic search algorithm is proposed to optimize the model to maintain its performance on the encrypted quantum data. Experimental results on simulation and the actual IBM quantum computer both prove the ability of PristiQ to provide high security for the quantum data while maintaining the model performance in QML. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs. © 2023 IEEE.},

This device extends to quantum computing from the classical concept of a secure enclave that isolates a computation from its environment to provide privacy and tamper-resistance. Remarkably, our QEnclave only performs single qubit rotations but can nevertheless be used to secure an arbitrary quantum computation even if the qubit source is controlled by an adversary. More precisely, by attaching a QEnclave to a quantum computer, a remote client controlling the QEnclave can securely delegate its computation to the server solely using classical communication. We investigate the security of our QEnclave by modeling it as an ideal functionality named remote state rotation (RSR). We show that this resource, similar to the previously introduced functionality of remote state preparation, allows blind delegated quantum computing with perfect security. Our proof under the Abstract Cryptography framework shows the construction of remote state preparation from remote state rotation while preserving security. An immediate consequence is the weakening of the requirements for blind delegated computation. While previous delegated protocols relied on a client that can either generate or measure quantum states, we show that this same functionality can be achieved with a client that only transforms quantum states without generating or measuring them. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers are widely used for quantum computing (QC) from quantum cloud providers. Among them, superconducting quantum computers, with their high scalability and mature processing technology based on traditional silicon-based chips, have become the preferred solution for most commercial companies and research institutions to develop QC. However, superconducting quantum computers suffer from fluctuation due to noisy environments. To maintain reliability for every execution, calibration of the quantum processor is significantly important. During the long procedure to calibrate physical quantum bits (qubits), quantum processors must be turned into offline mode. In this work, we propose a real-time calibration framework (RCF) to execute quantum program tasks and calibrate in-demand qubits simultaneously, without interrupting quantum processors. Across a widely used noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) evaluation benchmark suite such as QASMBench, RCF achieves up to 18\% reliability improvement for applications. For reliability on different physical qubits, RCF achieves an average gain of 15.7\% (up to 36.7\%). For cloud quantum machines, the throughput can be improved up to 9.5 throughput per minute (6.5 on average) based on baseline calibration time. In conclusion, RCF offers a reliable solution for large-scale, long-serving quantum machines. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The cloud services requiring communication, computing and caching (3C) resources are supported by datacenter networks (DCNs). The service security is threatened due to the development of quantum computers. Quantum key distribution (QKD) technology promises to share secret keys as cipher resources between remote users with information-Theoretic security. The quantum cloud is illustrated which is realized by the QKD-secured cloud datacenter network. In the quantum cloud, the communication, computing, caching and cipher (4C) resources are provided for data transmission, processing, storing and encryption. To solve the newly emerged 4C resource coordination problem, a 4C-oriented control architecture is designed and the heuristic algorithms for securing service function chains are innovatively proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve the great service success ratio performance compared with the baseline. © 2023 IFIP.},

The graph-based representation reflects how designers reason about and visualise algorithms, and allows automatic parallelism and asynchronicity. A strong, static type system and higher-order semantics allow for high expressivity and compositionality in the program. The flexible runtime protocol enables third-party developers to add functionality using any language or environment.

The characteristics of this paradigm and the lack of mature tools still make the process of defining, implementing, and running quantum, or hybrid classical-quantum software systems difficult compared with the procedures used for pure classical ones. To address this lack, we present a demonstration of a method for defining quantum services and the automatic generation of the corresponding source code through an extension of the Open API Specification. In this demo we present an extension that enables developers to define quantum services with a high abstraction level, link them with quantum circuits, and generate the source code of the service to be deployed in a quantum computer in the same way they do for classical services. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Smart Cities are becoming a reality now with ample interest and investment from both government and private entities. As the number of Smart Cities increases, so does the sheer size and variety of data, the major part of which comes from Internet of Things (IoT) sensors embedded in devices. Millions of intelligent devices may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or threats, potentially harming one or more connected devices or exposing sensitive data. Therefore, Smart Cities have Intelligent Operations Centers (IOC), using different machine learning (ML) algorithms to monitor the data and take necessary actions to protect or contain any security incident. The advent of Quantum Computing (QC) has led to many initiatives for using QC in various applications of a Smart City but using Quantum Computing as a service is not yet fully contemplated in this context. In this work, we propose an architecture for Smart City security using Quantum as a Service (QaaS) for analyzing and classifying Smart City data. The proposed architecture uses two different Quantum Classifiers, implemented in the D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud (QBoost) and IBM Quantum Services (Variational Quantum Classifier), for real-time classification of data and displays security incidents on a conveniently designed dashboard for further actions by the Security Operations Center (SOC) specialist. Further experiments have shown that D-Wave Leap Quantum Cloud-based QBoost performed the best among the quantum classifiers both regarding quality and time. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

These HQC algorithms help benchmark and validate the performance of such near-term quantum hardware. Equally important is the software platform that allows a remote user to program the quantum computer on the cloud. The recent Qiskit Runtime platform from IBM allows a seamless and prioritized access to quantum backends and co-located classical hardware within their hybrid cloud for optimized execution of HQC workloads. In contrast, IBM's Circuit API offers finer application definition but the classical resources are not co-located but placed farther away. Here, we study and contrast the execution flows of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) application defined using Qiskit Runtime, and an equivalent implementation using the Circuit API. We quantify the latencies of the various components in these execution. This offers insights on how to better orchestrate the execution of quantum applications across such hybrid resources. © 2023 IEEE.},

CC has emerged as an on-demand accessible tool in different practical applications such as digital industry, academics, manufacturing, health sector, and others. Backup, security, processing, and localization are all issues that the cloud is dealing with. As a result, quantum computing has seen tremendous growth in several domains. In literature, the majority of those researchers working on quantum believe it will solve the cloud service issues. Quantum cloud computing (QCC) entails the deployment of quantum computation sources in a cloud environment to overcome the following challenges and concerns that the existing model of simple cloud computation faces. However, not everyone is interested in combining physics-based atomic computing with software-based CC. This study will demonstrate all of the probable benefits and drawbacks of quantum computing (QC) when used in conjunction with a cloud system. The same also cover some of the most recent updates, as well as some uncertain prospects for quantum as a cloud service.

Existing work has yet to draw from research in edge computing to explore systems exploiting mobile QPUs, or how hybrid applications can benefit from distributed heterogeneous resources. Hence, this work presents an architecture for Quantum Computing in the edge-cloud continuum. We discuss the necessity, challenges, and solution approaches for extending existing work on classical edge computing to integrate QPUs. We describe how warm-starting allows defining workflows that exploit the hierarchical resources spread across the continuum. Then, we introduce a distributed inference engine with hybrid classical-quantum neural networks (QNNs) to aid system designers in accommodating applications with complex requirements that incur the highest degree of heterogeneity. We propose solutions focusing on classical layer partitioning and quantum circuit cutting to demonstrate the potential of utilizing classical and quantum computation across the continuum. To evaluate the importance and feasibility of our vision, we provide a proof of concept that exemplifies how extending a classical partition method to integrate quantum circuits can improve the solution quality. Specifically, we implement a split neural network with optional hybrid QNN predictors. Our results show that extending classical methods with QNNs is viable and promising for future work. © 2023 IEEE.},

Quantum computing relies on various types of processors, frameworks, algorithms, and simulators which can be accessed using Cloud services. Quantum computers provide an incredible processing power to the users. Having these quantum capabilities as services over cloud to access through internet is called Cloud-based quantum computing. Many tech giants have connected their quantum computers to the cloud platform and provided access to internet users from various sectors to be able to build and run simple programs on them. Industry-leading companies have started capitalizing on the capabilities of quantum technologies. It is exciting to see potentially transformative applications in the quantum algorithm space. Quantum computing software projects have significantly increased in areas where complex problems could be solved in very low-resolution times. From computing to communications, signal processing, navigation systems, quantum solutions offer unprecedented level of performance, privacy, security, and speed. The existing single layer architecture of providing Quantum as a service is still very basic and makes it complicated for users to have a choice over the kind of applications they would like to implement. This is because the services are not distinct and relevant to the needs of the users. This paper attempts to study IBM’s existing Quantum cloud platform and provides a multilayered enhanced approach with advanced quantum cloud services.

We propose a model-driven methodology that allows application developers, classical service developers, and quantum programmers to build hybrid enterprise applications collaboratively. As a result, quantum programmers and service developers can develop and publish quantum and classical components. At the same time, the application developers can discover, compose, configure and compose pre-built components to build and operate enterprise applications without intimate knowledge on the underlying quantum infrastructure, advocating knowledge reuse and separation of concerns. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

To reduce the measurement error and increase the efficiency of quantum entanglement (i.e. the capability of fault tolerance) in the current quantum computers and communications, we design a quantum-computing chip by modelling it as a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) quantum channel and obtain its channel capacity via our recently derived mutual information formula. To capture the internal qubit data flow dynamics of the channel, we model it via a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) with generalized stochastic pooling in terms of resource-competition among different quantum eigenmodes or users. The pooling is corresponding to a resource allocation policy with two levels of competitions as in cognitive radio: the first one is on users’ selection in a ‘win–lose’ manner; the second one is on resourcesharing among selected users in a ‘win–win’ manner. To wit, our scheduling policy is the one by mixing a saddle point to a zero-sum game problem and a Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium point to a nonzero- sum game problem. The effectiveness of our policy is proved by diffusion modelling with theory and numerical examples. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor \& Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The mission of QuTech is to bring quantum technology to industry and society by translating fundamental scientific research into applied research. To this end we are developing Quantum Inspire (QI), a full-stack quantum computer prototype for future co-development and collaborative R\&D in quantum computing. A prerelease of this prototype system is already offering the public cloud-based access to QuTech technologies such as a programmable quantum computer simulator (with up to 31 qubits) and tutorials and user background knowledge on quantum information science (www.quantum-inspire.com). Access to a programmable CMOS-compatible Silicon spin qubit-based quantum processor will be provided in the next deployment phase. The first generation of QI's quantum processors consists of a double quantum dot hosted in an in-house grown SiGe/28Si/SiGe heterostructure, and defined with a single layer of Al gates. Here we give an overview of important aspects of the QI full-stack. We illustrate QI's modular system architecture and we will touch on parts of the manufacturing and electrical characterization of its first generation two spin qubit quantum processor unit. We close with a section on QI's qubit calibration framework. The definition of a single qubit Pauli X gate is chosen as concrete example of the matching of an experiment to a component of the circuit model for quantum computation. © 2020 SPIE},

	abstract = {Quantum communication relies on the existence of entanglement between two nodes of a network. However, due to its fragile nature, it is nearly impossible to establish entanglement at large distances through the direct transmission of qubits. Quantum repeaters have been proposed to solve this problem, which split up the network to create small-scale entangled links and then connect them up to create the large-scale link. As researchers race to establish entanglement over larger and larger distances, it becomes essential to gauge the performance and robustness of different protocols that have been proposed to design a quantum repeater, before deploying them in real life. Currently available noisy quantum computers are ideal for this task, as they can emulate the noisy environment in a quantum communication channel, and provide a measure for how the protocols will perform on real-life hardware. In this paper, we report the circuit-level implementation of the complete architecture of a quantum repeater and benchmark this protocol on IBM’s cloud quantum computer—IBMQ. Our experiments indicate a 26\% fidelity of shared bell pairs for a complete on-chip quantum repeater with a yield of 49\%. We also compare these results with simulation data from IBM Qiskit. The results of our experiments provide a quantitative measure for the fidelity of entanglement that currently available repeaters can establish. In addition, the proposed circuit implementation provides a robust benchmark for state-of-the-art quantum computing hardware. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Quantum Computing is emerging as one of the great hopes for boosting current computational resources and enabling the application of ICT for optimizing processes and solving complex and challenging domain specific problems. However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this 'quantum advantage', a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept. © 2020 IEEE.},

With experimental demonstrations stretching back more than two decades, the quantum computing community has achieved a major milestone over the past few years: the ability to build systems that are stretching the limits of what can be classically simulated, and which enable cloud-based research for a wide range of scientists, thus increasing the pool of talent exploring early quantum systems. While such noisy near-term quantum computing systems fall far short of the requirements for fault-tolerant systems, they provide unique test beds for exploring the opportunities for quantum applications.

Today, there are numbers of cloud quantum computing services that can be accessed by users. They are used to solve complex problems that require powerful computing. Different cloud quantum computing services deliver different architecture and performances. In our study, we conducted a research on some services to test and evaluate the performances of different cloud quantum computing services and make a comparison out of it. The test will be conducted using two different methods such as visual programming and qiskit. From the result, we can see that the amount of qubit per backend and shots per run pretty much affect the execution time of a cloud quantum computing. This test will give the users some insight and enables them to decide which cloud quantum computing services deliver better performance or faster execution time based on the specification each cloud quantum computer offers. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

While transferring the data, some issues in the cloud environment are the lack of connectivity, control, and the insecurity of the password and the data. To handle this problem, data security and the internet connection have to be enabled for the cloud environments. The method of homomorphic encryption and the transport layer security protocol have been enabled for the analysis. The homomorphic encryption method converts the data to the ciphertext for making the text in the original format. Then the transport layer security protocol is used to authenticate the data, and the data integrity of the communication can be executed. The proposed system performs better than current protocols like Dynamic Level Based Integrity Checking Protocol, TLS protocol, and Lightweight Cryptosystem, making it a potential option for jobs involving safe and effective cloud information processing. Overall, the proposed Two-tier Homomorphic Encryption system exhibits improved execution time, security strength, resource utilization, communication overhead, and user satisfaction. It addresses issues such as connectivity gaps, control deficiencies, and password and data insecurity, making it an effective method for boosting cloud security in quantum cloud computing environments.},

	abstract = {The popularity of cloud computing platforms has risen dramatically in recent years. As cloud computing serves millions of users at the same time, it must be able to handle all those users' demands efficiently. Thus, choosing a suitable scheduling algorithm is crucial in the cloud computing environment in order to ensure efficient performance with a reasonable degree of quality of service (QoS). The primary goal of this research is to empirically implement and evaluate a recently proposed Round-Robin algorithm with smart time quantum (RR-STQ) in a cloud computing environment, as well as, to enhance the RR-STQ with a dynamic smart time quantum. The CloudSim tool was used to simulate the cloud computing platform to implement RR-STQ and evaluate it with several algorithms using different scenarios. In addition, three scheduling performance metrics were used in the evaluation process. In all comparison scenarios, the (RR-STQ) achieved a significant improvement rate in terms of average response time (RT). Moreover, (RR-STQ) has a better performance in the average turnaround time (TAT), waiting time (WT), and response time (RT) than the traditional RR algorithm. Also, the implemented algorithm (RR-STQ) with dynamic time quantum has a better performance than static time quantum. Based on the evaluation results, it is beneficial to integrate the RR algorithm with other scheduling models such as shortest job first (SJF) to enhance the WT and TAT. Furthermore, the investigations revealed that the dynamic time quantum improves the performance of the RR algorithm.},

For this application, a compact embedded processor board handles simple operations like data acquisition and pre-processing while a quantum cloud server is used to perform quantum computing simulations. This experimental setup is well suited for quantum computing as it is not feasible to embed a quantum processor at the edge, but practical to interface embedded processor boards to a quantum cloud server for processing massive audio data for a variety of recognition tasks.

	abstract = {In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, the emergence of cloud-based quantum services has opened up access to this cutting-edge technology for a broader user base. As demand for these services grows, the efficient and timely delivery of quantum computing capabilities becomes increasingly critical. However, current queuing methods for executing quantum tasks on specific machines often lead to inefficient resource usage and longer waiting times. In this paper, we present Moirai, a quantum serverless function orchestration framework to reduce the maximum completion time and improve device utilization. Leveraging the unique properties of quantum circuits, Moirai introduces a customized circuit representation scheme, incorporating Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) conversion and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embedding vector feature extraction. Central to Moirai is the use of reinforcement learning, which drives a suite of decision pipelines for device allocation and circuit deployment strategy. We conduct extensive evaluations involving 95 prevalent quantum algorithm circuits across 3∼7 qubits, utilizing 10 IBM quantum physical devices with three types of chip topologies. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances resource allocation efficiency and overall performance, achieving a noteworthy reduction in execution time of over 30\% compared to baseline methods. This underscores the effect of Moirai as a practical solution for optimizing quantum cloud services and unlocking the potential of quantum computing technology.},

	abstract = {What else than Hybrid Quantum Computing will dominate data centers, just within a decade? But until now, it is unclear how precisely such high-performance computers will be constructed, even the fundamental functionality is in question. Thus, it is very hard to prepare today, from a programmer perspective, in-depth for the anticipated near-term programming paradigm shift due to quantum computers. Furthermore, the industry is reluctant to invest heavily into quantum software development right now, since under this uncertainty regarding the future development of hardware and Cloud services, no one would like to see all these efforts to be ruined by a novel technology, an unforeseen new machine, which would eradicate the software in place, which the industry had developed so costly. This calls for a more generic view on Hybrid Quantum Computing, on one hand hardware agnostic, but still anticipating the fundamental laws of nature which rule any future quantum computing system, regardless of its engineered excellence. This generalization can be done with the introduction of a Virtual Quantum Processor, a piece of imaginary hardware, which is described detailed enough, to emulate a generic hybrid quantum machine based on a set of instructions within a Turing machine. If this could be accomplished, we would retrieve a Uniform Computing Model for Hybrid Quantum Software, which can be applied later to any physical representation of quantum computing hardware, but would run already today on our current machines.},

Quantum computers have been used successfully in the solution of non-deterministic polynomial-time problems for a while. Using quantum algorithms to find ways to speed up the computing of some hard problems reveals a concept called quantum supremacy. With the improvement of quantum computers and a decrease in error rates, companies that develop quantum computers have offered cloud-based platforms to make their computers publicly available and to be programmed via the web. The cloud programming approach likewise influenced the programming of quantum computers. Here, we present that it is possible to use these platforms with VR sets, which are now becoming widespread in the field of education, and we try to introduce which tools are used in quantum cloud programming.},

	abstract = {Truly random integers, which are the absolute requirement for this type of cryptography, are necessary for data security. Conventional PRNGs is deterministically which makes them predicted. This type of weakness is present in them. Unlike conventional algorithms, QRNG uses something very fundamental, quantum physics. It has allowed for a breakthrough in using random numbers that are unpredictable. The main goal of the project to design a system including the QRNG (quantum random number generator) and cloud platform developed by IBM. The system produces robust and ideal output for cryptography while being both effective and efficient. We will conduct detailed and effective tuning and testing so as to increase output. Outputs of this project are a QRNG system built on the cloud that can be connected with cryptographic applications, certified sequence, and informational materials of the organization. With this research of QRNGs synchronized with the IBM cloud platform, we make cryptographic security stronger by using the quantum mechanical method to create truly random numbers. Moreover, QRNGs contribute to the cryptographic applications which are intended to be incredibly secure and of high dependability by providing random numbers to enter the realm of crypto-with very little human participation. Basically, the cloud-based architecture enable systems to scale and possible failure resilience via migrating the workload or storing the data online. Quantum improvements will speed up the process of replacing the currently accepted cryptographic paradigm with something opening new ways of digital communication. This research is about quantum physics, cloud computing, and cryptography, bringing together how these concepts operate, as a result, of the unexpected and secure cryptographic applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are the next evolution of computing hardware. Quantum devices are being exposed through the same familiar cloud platforms used for classical computers, and enabling seamless execution of hybrid applications that combine quantum and classical components. Quantum devices vary in features, e.g., number of qubits, quantum volume, CLOPS, noise profile, queuing delays and resource cost. So, it may be useful to split hybrid workloads with either large quantum circuits or a large number of quantum circuits, into smaller units. In this paper, we profile two workload splitting techniques on IBM's Quantum Cloud: (1) Circuit parallelization, to split one large circuit into multiple smaller ones, and (2) Data parallelization to split a large number of circuits that run on one device to smaller batches of circuits that run on concurrently on multiple devices. These can improve the utilization of heterogeneous quantum hardware, but involve trade-offs. We evaluate these techniques on two key algorithmic classes: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), and measure the impact on quality of the result, circuit execution times, quantum resource usage, and processing overheads, relative to a baseline without such parallelization. The results are obtained on real hardware and complemented by simulations. We see that (1) VQE with circuit cutting is 39\% better in ground state estimation than the uncut version, and (2) QSVM that combines data parallelization with a reduced feature set yields upto 3 ×improvement in quantum workload execution time and reduces quantum resource use by 3 ×, while providing comparable accuracy. Error mitigation can improve the accuracy by ≈ 7\% and reduce resource footprint by ≈4\% compared to the best case among the considered scenarios.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers are difficult to reach by researchers because of the difficulty in manufacturing technologies and the need to provide ideal working conditions. As a solution, IBM Quantum (IBMQ) systems developed by IBM are accessed via the cloud. Although there are high qubit quantum backends currently offered for a fee, 5 and 7 qubit backends are publicly free. In this study, publicly free quantum backends in the IBM quantum experience environment are discussed. The study includes a comparative explanation of the factors affecting the performance of quantum computers. Quantum circuits were created in the IBM Composer environment and then run on the appropriate backend. Quantum circuits of 4mod5, which finds whether a 4-bit number is divisible by 5, 1-bitadder that performs 1-bit addition with the carry bit, and gray code, which finds the gray code equivalent of the binary number, were created. The created circuits were run on 8 different IBMQ backends and the results were analyzed. As a result of the analysis, it has been shown that while the simplicity of the gates used increases the performance rates, there may be different backends that operate each quantum circuit more accurately. It is hoped that the study will be a guide for researchers working on applied quantum computing.},

This led to a situation where we have substantially different quantum computing devices available thus far. They mostly differ in the number and kind of qubits and the connectivity between them. Because of that, various methods for realizing the intended quantum functionality on a given quantum computing device are available.

	abstract = {Quantum computing introduces a new computing paradigm that promises to solve problems that cannot be solved by classical computers efficiently. Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles. We further show how existing model-driven development (MDD) approach can be applied to refine a SDK-agnostic model to an executable SDK-specific model. We demonstrate the practical feasibility by a prototypical implementation as an extension of the TOSCA ecosystem OpenTOSCA and three case studies with IBMQ and a quantum simulator.},

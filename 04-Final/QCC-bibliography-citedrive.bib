    Quantum computing is a rapidly progressing field: quantum computers are becoming more powerful and an increasing number of functionalities are offered via various quantum platforms and quantum software packages. Current quantum computers can be used almost exclusively via cloud services. It is expected that this will remain the case, at least in the near-term future. For successful adoption of quantum computing by the market, quantum cloud services should be user-centric. To that end, we explore quantum cloud computing from a user perspective. We describe a standardised overview of quantum cloud computing as a whole to create a common language to strengthen research and collaboration on quantum cloud computing. Specifically, we identify different types, information flows and relevant user functionalities of
    quantum cloud computing, based on their counterparts in classical cloud computing. Combined, this gives an overview of quantum cloud computing for the best user experience, paving the way towards user-centric quantum cloud computing.

    abstract = {Despite the current progress in quantum computing, the reliability of quantum computers is very challenging. Near-term quantum computers referred to as Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are expected to operate in the presence of errors. To run a quantum circuit on a NISQ computer, the circuit should be mapped to satisfy the physical constraints of the quantum architecture. The mapping process takes into account the error rates of the quantum hardware. It selects physical qubits and their movements, which minimize the circuit error rates. The output of the quantum circuit can be obtained through several runs on NISQ computers.What's important from a security perspective is that the output of the quantum circuit is inherently dependent on the error parameters of the quantum hardware. An adversary can, therefore, leverage such dependency to alter the functional behavior of the quantum circuit. We show that malicious changes in the error rates used for mapping quantum circuits can change their output. To detect this attack on NISQ architectures, we propose inserting test points into the quantum circuits to study their error rates with respect to other qubit allocations. We utilize superposition, classical, and un-compute tests to provide side-channel information of the quantum circuit. We study the effectiveness of our approach using IBMQ 16 Melbourne quantum computer and Qiskit tools as an exemplar.},

    The growing quantity of public and private data sets focused on small molecules screened against biological targets or whole organisms provides a wealth of drug discovery relevant data. This is matched by the availability of machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) that are computationally expensive to perform on very large data sets with thousands of molecular descriptors. Quantum computer (QC) algorithms have been proposed to offer an approach to accelerate quantum machine learning over classical computer (CC) algorithms, however with significant limitations. In the case of cheminformatics, which is widely used in drug discovery, one of the challenges to overcome is the need for compression of large numbers of molecular descriptors for use on a QC.
    Here, we show how to achieve compression with data sets using hundreds of molecules (SARS-CoV-2) to hundreds of thousands of molecules (whole cell screening data sets for plague and M. tuberculosis) with SVM and the data reuploading classifier (a DNN equivalent algorithm) on a QC benchmarked against CC and hybrid approaches. This study illustrates the steps needed in order to be ``quantum computer ready'' in order to apply quantum computing to drug discovery and to provide the foundation on which to build this field.

    The learning process of classical machine learning algorithms is tuned by hyperparameters that need to be customized to best learn and generalize from an input dataset. In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has been gaining traction as a possible application of quantum computing which may provide quantum advantage in the future. However, quantum versions of classical machine learning algorithms introduce a plethora of additional parameters and circuit variations that have their own intricacies in being tuned.In this work, we take the first steps towards Automated Quantum Machine Learning (AutoQML). We propose a concrete description of the problem, and then develop a classical-quantum hybrid cloud architecture that allows for parallelized hyperparameter exploration and model training.As an
    application use-case, we train a quantum Generative Adversarial neural Network (qGAN) to generate energy prices that follow a known historic data distribution. Such a QML model can be used for various applications in the energy economics sector.

    The Cloud computing paradigm has revolutionised the computer science horizon during the past decade and has enabled the emergence of computing as the fifth utility. It has captured significant attention of academia, industries, and government bodies. Now, it has emerged as the backbone of modern economy by offering subscription-based services anytime, anywhere following a pay-as-you-go model. This has instigated (1) shorter establishment times for start-ups, (2) creation of scalable global enterprise applications, (3) better cost-to-value associativity for scientific and high-performance computing applications, and (4) different invocation/execution models for pervasive and ubiquitous applications. The recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing, software-defined networking,
    Internet of Things, and processing at network edge are creating new opportunities for Cloud computing. However, they are also posing several new challenges and creating the need for new approaches and research strategies, as well as the re-evaluation of the models that were developed to address issues such as scalability, elasticity, reliability, security, sustainability, and application models. The proposed manifesto addresses them by identifying the major open challenges in Cloud computing, emerging trends, and impact areas. It then offers research directions for the next decade, thus helping in the realisation of Future Generation Cloud Computing.

    through quantum links in synergy with classical ones, is envisioned as the
    final stage of the quantum revolution, opening fundamentally new
    communications and computing capabilities. But the Quantum Internet is
    governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. Phenomena with no counterpart in
    classical networks, such as no-cloning, quantum measurement, entanglement and
    quantum teleportation, impose new challenging constraints for network design.
    Specifically, classical network functionalities are based on the assumption
    that classical information can be safely read and copied. However, this
    assumption does not hold in the Quantum Internet. As a consequence, its
    design requires a major network-paradigm shift to harness the quantum
    mechanics specificities. The goal of this work is to shed light on the
    challenges and open problems of Quantum Internet design. We first introduce
    some basic knowledge of quantum mechanics, needed to understand the
    differences between a classical and a quantum network. Then, we introduce
    quantum teleportation as the key strategy for transmitting quantum
    information without physically transferring the particle that stores the
    quantum information or violating the principles of quantum mechanics.
    Finally, the key research challenges to design quantum communication networks
    are discussed.

    abstract = {
    With the significant advances in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) over the last half century, there is an increasingly perceived vision that computing will one day be the 5th utility (after water, electricity, gas, and telephony). This computing utility, like all other four existing utilities, will provide the basic level of computing service that is considered essential to meet the everyday needs of the general community. To deliver this vision, a number of computing paradigms have been proposed, of which the latest one is known as Cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we define Cloud computing and provide the architecture for creating Clouds with market-oriented resource allocation by leveraging technologies such as Virtual Machines (VMs). We also provide insights on market-based resource
    management strategies that encompass both customer-driven service management and computational risk management to sustain Service Level Agreement (SLA)-oriented resource allocation. In addition, we reveal our early thoughts on interconnecting Clouds for dynamically creating global Cloud exchanges and markets. Then, we present some representative Cloud platforms, especially those developed in industries, along with our current work towards realizing market-oriented resource allocation of Clouds as realized in Aneka enterprise Cloud technology. Furthermore, we highlight the difference between High Performance Computing (HPC) workload and Internet-based services workload. We also describe a meta-negotiation infrastructure to establish global Cloud exchanges and markets, and illustrate a case study of harnessing
    `Storage Clouds' for high performance content delivery. Finally, we conclude with the need for convergence of competing IT paradigms to deliver our 21st century vision.

    abstract = {Abstract Cloud computing is a recent advancement wherein IT infrastructure and applications are provided as `services' to end-users under a usage-based payment model. It can leverage virtualized services even on the fly based on requirements (workload patterns and QoS) varying with time. The application services hosted under Cloud computing model have complex provisioning, composition, configuration, and deployment requirements. Evaluating the performance of Cloud provisioning policies, application workload models, and resources performance models in a repeatable manner under varying system and user configurations and requirements is difficult to achieve. To overcome this challenge, we propose CloudSim: an extensible simulation toolkit that enables modeling and simulation of Cloud computing systems and
    application provisioning environments. The CloudSim toolkit supports both system and behavior modeling of Cloud system components such as data centers, virtual machines (VMs) and resource provisioning policies. It implements generic application provisioning techniques that can be extended with ease and limited effort. Currently, it supports modeling and simulation of Cloud computing environments consisting of both single and inter-networked clouds (federation of clouds). Moreover, it exposes custom interfaces for implementing policies and provisioning techniques for allocation of VMs under inter-networked Cloud computing scenarios. Several researchers from organizations, such as HP Labs in U.S.A., are using CloudSim in their investigation on Cloud resource provisioning and energy-efficient management of data
    center resources. The usefulness of CloudSim is demonstrated by a case study involving dynamic provisioning of application services in the hybrid federated clouds environment. The result of this case study proves that the federated Cloud computing model significantly improves the application QoS requirements under fluctuating resource and service demand patterns.

The aim of this study is to provide the reader with an overview about the main challenges and open problems arising in the design of a distributed quantum computing ecosystem. For this, the authors provide a survey, following a bottom-up approach, from a communications engineering perspective. They start by introducing the Quantum Internet as the fundamental underlying infrastructure of the
    distributed quantum computing ecosystem. Then they go further, by elaborating on a high-level system abstraction of the distributed quantum computing ecosystem. They describe such an abstraction through a set of logical layers. Thereby, they clarify dependencies among the aforementioned layers and, at the same time, a road-map emerges.

    Existing and near-term quantum computers face significant reliability challenges because of high error rates caused by noise. Such machines are operated in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) model of computing. As NISQ machines exhibit high error-rates, only programs that require a few qubits can be executed reliably. Therefore, NISQ machines tend to underutilize its resources. In this paper, we propose to improve the throughput and utilization of NISQ machines by using multi-programming and enabling the NISQ machine to concurrently execute multiple workloads.Multi-programming a NISQ machine is non-trivial. This is because, a multi-programmed NISQ machine can have an adverse impact on the reliability of the individual workloads. To enable multi-programming in a robust manner, we propose three
    solutions. First, we develop methods to partition the qubits into multiple reliable regions using error information from machine calibration so that each program can have a fair allocation of reliable qubits. Second, we observe that when two programs are of unequal lengths, measurement operations can impact the reliability of the co-running program. To reduce this interference, we propose a Delayed Instruction Scheduling (DIS) policy that delays the start of the shorter program so that all the measurement operations can be performed at the end. Third, we develop an Adaptive Multi-Programming (AMP) design that monitors the reliability at runtime and reverts to single program mode if the reliability impact of multi-programming is greater than a predefined threshold. Our evaluations with IBM-Q16 show that our
    proposals can improve resource utilization and throughput by up to 2x, while limiting the impact on reliability.

    Quantum computing technology has reached a second renaissance in the past five years. Increased interest from both the private and public sector combined with extraordinary theoretical and experimental progress has solidified this technology as a major advancement in the 21st century. As anticipated my many, some of the first realizations of quantum computing technology has occured over the cloud, with users logging onto dedicated hardware over the classical internet. Recently, IBM has released the Quantum Experience, which allows users to access a five-qubit quantum processor. In this paper we take advantage of this online availability of actual quantum hardware and present four quantum information experiments. We utilize the IBM chip to realize protocols in quantum error correction, quantum arithmetic,
    quantum graph theory, and fault-tolerant quantum computation by accessing the device remotely through the cloud. While the results are subject to significant noise, the correct results are returned from the chip. This demonstrates the power of experimental groups opening up their technology to a wider audience and will hopefully allow for the next stage of development in quantum information technology.

    We present a new scheme for quantum homomorphic encryption which is compact and allows for efficient evaluation of arbitrary polynomial-sized quantum circuits. Building on the framework of Broadbent and Jeffery [BJ15] and recent results in the area of instantaneous non-local quantum computation [Spe15], we show how to construct quantum gadgets that allow perfect correction of the errors which occur during the homomorphic evaluation of T gates on encrypted quantum data. Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme and requires no computational assumptions besides those already used by the classical scheme. The size of our quantum gadget depends on the space complexity of the classical decryption function -- which aligns well with the current efforts to minimize
    the complexity of the decryption function.

    Smart Healthcare systems compromise complex computations such as visualization of molecules, analysis of DNA, and therapy determination. These are considered to be complex problems that today's supercomputers are still facing. On the other hand, Quantum computing promises fast, efficient, and scalable computing resources that are sufficient to compute large and complex operations in exponential time. It is a fact that Quantum computing will adequately innovate the computation perspective. However, it is not a feasible solution yet as it is likely to be rare and highly expensive to produce. This paper presents a Quantum Cloud-as-a-service for an efficient, scalable, and secure solution for complex Smart Healthcare computations.

    Security and privacy have always been key concerns for individuals in various cloud-assisted services. In order to enhance security, we focus on quantum cryptography in novel cloud-based applications. First, we present two quantum primitive protocols to compute XOR of two private bits and AND of two private bits with the assistance of a quantum cloud, respectively. Then, we generalize two-party protocols to the corresponding multi-party cases. These quantum primitive protocols can ensure information-theoretical security and provide long-term security, which are guaranteed by the principles of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we present a grouping strategy to improve the communication efficiency of multiparty quantum protocols. In addition, we investigate privacy-preserving applications of these quantum
    primitive protocols in cloud-based environments, e.g., cloud-based Anonymous Voting and Multiparty Private Set Intersection. Finally, simulated experiments show our proposed quantum protocols are correct and feasible with the present quantum technology.

    The quantum internet is envisioned as the ultimate stage of the quantum revolution, which surpasses its classical counterpart in various aspects, such as the efficiency of data transmission, the security of network services, and the capability of information processing. Given its disruptive impact on the national security and the digital economy, a global race to build scalable quantum networks has already begun. With the joint effort of national governments, industrial participants, and research institutes, the development of quantum networks has advanced rapidly in recent years, bringing the first primitive quantum networks within reach. In this work, we aim to provide an up-to-date review of the field of quantum networks from both theoretical and experimental perspectives, contributing to a better
    understanding of the building blocks required for the establishment of a global quantum internet. We also introduce a newly developed quantum network toolkit to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of innovative ideas. Particularly, it provides dual quantum computing engines, supporting simulations in both the quantum circuit and measurement-based models. It also includes a compilation scheme for mapping quantum network protocols onto quantum circuits, enabling their emulations on real-world quantum hardware devices. We showcase the power of this toolkit with several featured demonstrations, including a simulation of the Micius quantum satellite experiment, a testing of a four-layer quantum network architecture with resource management, and a quantum emulation of the CHSH game. We hope this work can
    give a better understanding of the state-of-the-art development of quantum networks and provide the necessary tools to make further contributions along the way.

    Abstract The advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology is changing rapidly the landscape and modality of research in quantum physics. NISQ devices, such as the IBM Q Experience, have very recently proven their capability as experimental platforms accessible to everyone around the globe. Until now, IBM Q Experience processors have mostly been used for quantum computation and simulation of closed systems. Here, we show that these devices are also able to implement a great variety of paradigmatic open quantum systems models, hence providing a robust and flexible testbed for open quantum systems theory. During the last decade an increasing number of experiments have successfully tackled the task of simulating open quantum systems in different platforms, from linear optics to trapped ions, from
    nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to cavity quantum electrodynamics. Generally, each individual experiment demonstrates a specific open quantum system model, or at most a specific class. Our main result is to prove the great versatility of the IBM Q Experience processors. Indeed, we experimentally implement one and two-qubit open quantum systems, both unital and non-unital dynamics, Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. Moreover, we realise proof-of-principle reservoir engineering for entangled state generation, demonstrate collisional models, and verify revivals of quantum channel capacity and extractable work, caused by memory effects. All these results are obtained using IBM Q Experience processors publicly available and remotely accessible online.

Legal and ethical requirements may prevent the use of cloud-based machine learning solutions for such tasks. In this work, we will present a method to convert learned neural networks to CryptoNets, neural networks that can be applied to encrypted data. This allows a data owner to send their data in an encrypted form to a cloud service that hosts the network. The encryption ensures that the data remains confidential since the cloud does not have access to the keys needed to decrypt it. Nevertheless, we will show that the cloud service is capable of applying the neural network to the encrypted data
    to make encrypted predictions, and also return them in encrypted form. These encrypted predictions can be sent back to the owner of the secret key who can decrypt them. Therefore, the cloud service does not gain any information about the raw data nor about the prediction it made. We demonstrate CryptoNets on the MNIST optical character recognition tasks. CryptoNets achieve 99% accuracy and can make around 59000 predictions per hour on a single PC. Therefore, they allow high throughput, accurate, and private predictions.

    abstract = {
    Quantum k-means algorithm is widely used in solving clustering problems. However, the repeated calculation of the core subroutines overloads the quantum computer with mass computing tasks. In addition, due to the decoherence of the quantum state, the computing power of personal quantum computer is limited. Therefore, it is necessary to use high-performance quantum cloud computing to complete data processing. This paper proposes a quantum k-means algorithm in quantum cloud computing, which uploads the data to the server to execute the core subroutines SwapT est (calculating the similarity between ciphertext quantum states) and Gr over O ptim (quantum minimization algorithm) of quantum k-means algorithm and then sends the ciphertext to the client for further decryption using the decryption key, which reduces
    the load of the client. An improved quantum homomorphic encryption by t-gate updating in trusted server and data processing in semi-trusted server is introduced as well. In this scheme, the trusted server assists the semi-trusted server to execute the T -gate existing in the quantum circuit, which separates the key from the ciphertext and ensure the security of the ciphertext data processing in the quantum cloud. In our experiment, the two subroutines, SwapT est and Gr over O ptim, are conducted in ciphertext and plaintext conditions by using IBM Qiskit to evaluate the reliability and feasibility. The result shows that the decrypted ciphertext result is the same as the plaintext. We conclude that the proposed algorithm has a better performance in reducing the cost of load in client and protecting privacy
    data in cloud by contrast with the original quantum k-means algorithm.

    Summary The new era of artificial intelligence (AI) aims to entangle the relationships among models (characterizations), algorithms, and implementations toward the high-level intelligence with general cognitive ability, strong robustness, and interpretability, which is intractable for machine learning (ML). Quantum computer provides a new computing paradigm for ML. Although universal quantum computers are still in infancy, special-purpose D-Wave machine hopefully becomes the breaking point of commercialized quantum computing. The core principle, quantum annealing (QA), enables the quantum system to naturally evolve toward the low-energy states. D-Wave's quantum computer has developed some applications of quantum ML based on quantum-assisted ML algorithms, quantum Boltzmann machine, etc. Additionally, working
    with CPUs, quantum processing units is likely to advance ML in a quantum-inspired way. Thus, a new advanced computing architecture, quantum-classical hybrid approach consisting of QA, classical computing, and brain-inspired cognitive science, is required to explore its superiority to universal quantum algorithms and classical ML algorithms. It is important to explore hybrid quantum/classical approaches to overcome the defects of ML such as high dependence on training data, low robustness to the noises, and cognitive impairment. The new framework is expected to gradually form a highly effective, accurate, and adaptive intelligent computing architecture for the next generation of AI.

We integrate four different types of quantum random number generators on the Alibaba Cloud servers to enhance cybersecurity. Post-processing modules are integrated into the quantum platform to extract true random numbers. We employ improved authentication protocols where original pseudo-random numbers are replaced with quantum ones. Users from the Alibaba Cloud, such as Ant Financial and Smart Access Gateway, request random numbers from the quantum platform for various cryptographic tasks. For cloud services demanding the highest security, such as Alipay at Ant Financial, we combine the random numbers from four

    Cloud computing provides its clients with ondemand resources, such as storage and performance. The idea behind cloud computing is sharing of resources. With growth of cloud computing, the risks of security and privacy are arising. Also, the cloud resources are not secure against quantum computers, as quantum computing threatens the best security controls implemented today, that include ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), RSA, DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) and ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm). Fortunately, there are quantum-safe digital signatures called Hashbased Signatures, which can also protect integrity, authentication and privacy on the cloud. In this work, a hash-based digital signature scheme called WOTS is implemented to avoid security risks imposed by quantum computing on cloud
    computing. The implementation is carried out in CloudSim simulator. Apart from achieving quantum safety, the results show that our proposed solution is computationally cost effective.

Our work tackles this problem in the context of prediction-as-a-service wherein a server has a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on its private data and wishes to provide classifications on clients' private images. Our goal is to build efficient secure computation protocols which allow a client to obtain the classification result without revealing their input to the server, while at the same preserving the privacy of the server's neural network.To this end, we design Gazelle, a scalable and low-latency system for secure neural network inference, using an intricate combination of homomorphic encryption and traditional two-party computation techniques (such as garbled circuits). Gazelle makes three contributions. First, we design a homomorphic encryption library which provides fast implementations of basic homomorphic operations such as SIMD (single instruction multiple data) addition, SIMD multiplication and ciphertext slot permutation. Second, we implement homomorphic linear algebra kernels which provide fast algorithms that map neural network layers to optimized homomorphic matrix-vector multiplication and convolution routines. Third, we design optimized encryption switching protocols which seamlessly convert between homomorphic and garbled circuit encodings to enable implementation of complete neural network inference.We evaluate our protocols on benchmark neural networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets and show that Gazelle outperforms the best existing systems such as MiniONN (ACM CCS 2017) and Chameleon (Crypto Eprint 2017/1164) by 20-30\texttimes{} in online runtime. When compared with fully homomorphic approaches like CryptoNets (ICML 2016), we demonstrate three orders of magnitude faster online run-time.},

    abstract = {Quantum cloud computing is a promising paradigm for efficiently provisioning quantum resources (i.e., qubits) to users. In quantum cloud computing, quantum cloud providers provision quantum resources in reservation and on-demand plans for users. Literally, the cost of quantum resources in the reservation plan is expected to be cheaper than the cost of quantum resources in the on-demand plan. However, quantum resources in the reservation plan have to be reserved in advance without information about the requirement of quantum circuits beforehand, and consequently, the resources are insufficient, i.e., under-reservation. Hence, quantum resources in the on-demand plan can be used to compensate for the unsatisfied quantum resources required. To end this, we propose a quantum resource allocation for the quantum
    cloud computing system in which quantum resources and the minimum waiting time of quantum circuits are jointly optimized. Particularly, the objective is to minimize the total costs of quantum circuits under uncertainties regarding qubit requirement and minimum waiting time of quantum circuits. In experiments, practical circuits of quantum Fourier transform are applied to evaluate the proposed qubit resource allocation. The results illustrate that the proposed qubit resource allocation can achieve the optimal total costs.

    Quantum computing systems rely on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform a multitude of computationally challenging tasks more efficiently than their classical counterparts. The architecture of software-intensive systems can empower architects who can leverage architecture-centric processes, practices, description languages to model, develop, and evolve quantum computing software (quantum software for short) at higher abstraction levels. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to investigate (i) architectural process, (ii) modelling notations, (iii) architecture design patterns, (iv) tool support, and (iv) challenging factors for quantum software architecture. Results of the SLR indicate that quantum software represents a new genre of software-intensive systems; however, existing processes
    and notations can be tailored to derive the architecting activities and develop modelling languages for quantum software. Quantum bits (Qubits) mapped to Quantum gates (Qugates) can be represented as architectural components and connectors that implement quantum software. Tool-chains can incorporate reusable knowledge and human roles (e.g., quantum domain engineers, quantum code developers) to automate and customise the architectural process. Results of this SLR can facilitate researchers and practitioners to develop new hypotheses to be tested, derive reference architectures, and leverage architecture-centric principles and practices to engineer emerging and next generations of quantum software.

Quantum True Random Number Generator (QTRNG) can yield real random data to replace random-looking periodic sequences. Here, we present the fastest QTRNG on factual Quantum Computational Devices (QCD) locally on our device to save time. To construct a random number generator, the IBM Q Experience called Qiskit is used. The ease of our source Hadamard gate pooled with its verifiably sole randomness is imperative for attaining quantum random number generators at no cost. The inner matrix product of the square of the Hadamard gate is proved to be identified in the quantum lab. Applying the H gate twice on the quantum register cancelled out the H gate pair. It acted as a single Hadamard gate that was practically visualised using
    the IMB Q experience. The 24-qubit random number is experimented with and investigated in this work. The min-entropy of such generated random numbers is 0.0007244 with the worst-case entropy value of 0.999507. Besides, subsequent verification of genuine randomness was confirmed by steering restart experimentation, \& the statistical properties of TRNG were evaluated over autocorrelation study, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-90B \& 800-22 tests.

    Quantum random number generator (QRNG) relies on the intrinsic randomness of quantum mechanics to produce true random numbers which are important in information processing tasks. Due to the presence of the superposition state, a quantum computer can be used as a true random number generator. However, in practice, the implementation of the quantum computer is subject to various noise sources, which affects the randomness of the generated random numbers. To solve this problem, we propose a scheme based on the quantum computer which is motivated by the source-independent QRNG scheme in optics. By using a method to estimate the upper bound of the superposition state preparation error, the scheme can provide certified randomness in the presence of readout errors. To increase the generation rate of random bits, we
    also provide a parameter optimization method with a finite data size. In addition, we experimentally demonstrate our scheme on the cloud superconducting quantum computers of IBM.

    For a specific quantum chip, multi-programming improves overall throughput and resource utilization. Previous studies on mapping multiple programs often lead to resource under-utilization, high error rate, and low fidelity. This paper proposes QuCloud, a new approach for mapping quantum programs in the cloud environment. We have three new designs in QuCloud. (1) We leverage the community detection technique to partition physical qubits among concurrent quantum programs, avoiding the waste of robust resources. (2) We design X-SWAP scheme that enables inter-program SWAPs and prioritizes SWAPs associated with critical gates to reduce the SWAP overheads. (3) We propose a compilation task scheduler that schedules concurrent quantum programs to be compiled and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best
    practice. We evaluate our work on publicly available quantum computer IBMQ16 and a simulated quantum chip IBMQ50. Our work outperforms the state-of-The-Art work for multi-programming on fidelity and compilation overheads by 9.7\% and 11.6\%, respectively.

    The convergence of quantum cryptography with applications used in everyday life is a topic drawing attention from the industrial and academic worlds. The development of quantum electronics has led to the practical achievement of quantum devices that are already available on the market and waiting for their first application on a broader scale. A major aspect of quantum cryptography is the methodology of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is used to generate and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically separate users using the principles of quantum physics. In previous years, several successful QKD networks have been created to test the implementation and interoperability of different practical solutions. This article surveys previously applied methods, showing techniques for
    deploying QKD networks and current challenges of QKD networking. Unlike studies focusing on optical channels and optical equipment, this survey focuses on the network aspect by considering network organization, routing and signaling protocols, simulation techniques, and a software-defined QKD networking approach.

    beginning to attract the interest of companies that could potentially be

    next few years hybrid systems will start to appear integrating both the
    classical software systems of companies and new quantum ones providing
    solutions to problems that still remain unmanageable today. A natural way to
    support such integration is Service-Oriented Computing. While conceptually
    the invocation of a quantum software service is similar to that of a
    classical one, technically there are many differences and technological
    limitations, which refer to platform independence, decoupling, scalability,
    etc. To highlight these differences and the difficulties to develop quality
    quantum services, this paper takes a well-known problem to which a quantum
    solution can be provided, integer factorization, making use of the Amazon
    Braket quantum service platform. The exercise of trying to provide the
    factorization as a quantum service is carried out following the best
    practices, design patterns and standards existing in the implementation of
    classical services. This case study is used to highlight the rough edges and
    limitations that arise in the integration of classical-quantum hybrid systems
    using service-oriented computing. The conclusion of the study allows us to
    point out directions in which to focus research efforts in order to achieve
    effective quantum service-oriented computing.

    abstract = {With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed
    quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via
    quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However,
    DQC faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or
    duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics,
    quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks.
    However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum
    computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and
    properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In
    this paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on
    stochastic programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum
    resources. Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is
    formulated to handle the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing
    power, and fidelity in quantum networks. The performance evaluation
    demonstrates the effectiveness and ability of the proposed scheme to balance
    the utilization of quantum computers and on-demand quantum computers while
    minimizing the overall cost of provisioning under uncertainty.

NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away - we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future.

    hardware in the short term. Only small circuits can be executed reliably on a
    quantum machine due to the unavoidable noisy quantum operations on NISQ
    devices, leading to the under-utilization of hardware resources. With the
    growing demand to access quantum hardware, how to utilize it more efficiently
    while maintaining output fidelity is becoming a timely issue. A parallel

    executing multiple programs on hardware simultaneously. It can improve the

    In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, the idea of quantum multiprogramming, running multiple quantum circuits (QCs) simultaneously on the same hardware, helps to improve the throughput of quantum computation. However, the crosstalk, unwanted interference between qubits on NISQ processors, may cause performance degradation when using multiprogramming. To address this challenge, we introduce palloq (parallel allocation of QCs), a novel compilation protocol. Palloq improves the performance of quantum multiprogramming on NISQ processors, while paying attention to 1) the combination of QCs chosen for parallel execution and 2) the assignment of program qubit variables to physical qubits, to reduce unwanted interference among the active set of QCs. We also propose a software-based crosstalk detection
    protocol using a new combination of randomized benchmarking methods. Our method successfully characterizes the suitability of hardware for multiprogramming with relatively low detection costs. We found a tradeoff between the success rate and execution time of the multiprogramming. Our results will be of value when device throughput becomes a significant bottleneck. Until service providers have enough quantum processors available to more than meet demand, this approach will be attractive to the service providers and users who want to optimize job management and throughput of the processor.

    As quantum computers mature, the complexity of quantum software increases. As we move from the initial standalone quantum algorithms toward complex solutions combining quantum algorithms with traditional software, new software engineering methods and abstractions are needed. Nowadays, quantum computers are usually offered in the cloud, under a pay-per-use model, leading to the adoption of the service-oriented good practices that dominate the cloud today. However, specific adaptations are needed to reap the benefits of service-oriented computing while dealing with quantum hardware limitations. In this article, we propose the Quantum API Gateway-an adaptation of the API Gateway pattern that takes into account the fact that quantum services cannot be deployed as traditional services. Instead, the Quantum API
    Gateway recommends the best quantum computer to run a specific quantum service at run time. As proof of concept, we provide an implementation of the Quantum API Gateway for the Amazon Braket platform.

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

  },

    abstract = {Qubit mapping for NISQ superconducting quantum computers is essential to
    fidelity and resource utilization. The existing qubit mapping schemes meet
    challenges, e.g., crosstalk, SWAP overheads, diverse device topologies, etc.,
    leading to qubit resource underutilization and low fidelity in computing
    results. This paper introduces QuCloud+, a new qubit mapping scheme that
    tackles these challenges. QuCloud+ has several new designs. (1) QuCloud+
    supports single/multi-programming quantum computing on quantum chips with
    2D/3D topology. (2) QuCloud+ partitions physical qubits for concurrent
    quantum programs with the crosstalk-aware community detection technique and
    further allocates qubits according to qubit degree, improving fidelity and
    resource utilization. (3) QuCloud+ includes an X-SWAP mechanism that avoids
    SWAPs with high crosstalk errors and enables inter-program SWAPs to reduce
    the SWAP overheads. (4) QuCloud+ schedules concurrent quantum programs to be
    mapped and executed based on estimated fidelity for the best practice.
    Experimental results show that, compared with the existing typical
    multi-programming study\&nbsp;[12], QuCloud+ achieves up to 9.03\% higher
    fidelity and saves on the required SWAPs during mapping, reducing the number
    of CNOT gates inserted by 40.92\%. Compared with a recent study\&nbsp;[30]
    that enables post-mapping gate optimizations to further reduce gates,
    QuCloud+ reduces the post-mapping circuit depth by 21.91\% while using a
    similar number of gates.

    As the popularity of quantum computing continues to grow, quantum machine access over the cloud is critical to both academic and industry researchers across the globe. And as cloud quantum computing demands increase exponentially, the analysis of resource consumption and execution characteristics are key to efficient management of jobs and resources at both the vendor-end as well as the client-end. While the analysis of resource consumption and management are popular in the classical HPC domain, it is severely lacking for more nascent technology like quantum computing. This paper is a first-of-its-kind academic study, analyzing various trends in job execution and resources consumption / utilization on quantum cloud systems. We focus on IBM Quantum systems and analyze characteristics over a two year period,
    encompassing over 6000 jobs which contain over 600,000 quantum circuit executions and correspond to almost 10 billion ``shots'' or trials over 20+ quantum machines. Specifically, we analyze trends focused on, but not limited to, execution times on quantum machines, queuing/waiting times in the cloud, circuit compilation times, machine utilization, as well as the impact of job and machine characteristics on all of these trends. Our analysis identifies several similarities and differences with classical HPC cloud systems. Based on our insights, we make recommendations and contributions to improve the management of resources and jobs on future quantum cloud systems.

    Benchmarking is how the performance of a computing system is determined. Surprisingly, even for classical computers this is not a straightforward process. One must choose the appropriate benchmark and metrics to extract meaningful results. Different benchmarks test the system in different ways, and each individual metric may or may not be of interest. Choosing the appropriate approach is tricky. The situation is even more open ended for quantum computers, where there is a wider range of hardware, fewer established guidelines, and additional complicating factors. Notably, quantum noise significantly impacts performance and is difficult to model accurately. Here, we discuss benchmarking of quantum computers from a computer architecture perspective and provide numerical simulations highlighting challenges that

    Quantum computing can enable a variety of breakthroughs in research and industry in the future. Although some quantum algorithms already exist that show a theoretical speedup compared to the best known classical algorithms, the implementation and execution of these algorithms come with several challenges. The input data determines, for example, the required number of qubits and gates of a quantum algorithm. A quantum algorithm implementation also depends on the used Software Development Kit which restricts the set of usable quantum computers. Because of the limited capabilities of current quantum computers, choosing an appropriate one to execute a certain implementation for a given input is a difficult challenge that requires immense mathematical knowledge about the implemented quantum algorithm as well as
    technical knowledge about the used Software Development Kits. In this paper, we present a concept for the automated analysis and selection of implementations of quantum algorithms and appropriate quantum computers that can execute a selected implementation with a certain input data. The practical feasibility of the concept is demonstrated by the prototypical implementation of a tool that we call NISQ Analyzer.

    Quantum computing is the latest revolution in computing and will probably come to be seen an advance as important as the steam engine or the information society. In the last few decades, our understanding of quantum computers has expanded and multiple efforts have been made to create languages, libraries, tools, and environments to facilitate their programming. Nonetheless, quantum computers are complex systems at the bottom of a stack of layers that programmers need to understand. Hence, efforts towards creating quantum programming languages and computing environments that can abstract low-level technology details have become crucial steps to achieve a useful quantum computing technology. However, most of these environments still lack many of the features that would be desirable, such as those outlined in
    The Talavera Manifesto for Quantum Software Engineering and Programming. For advancing quantum computing, we will need to develop quantum software engineering techniques and tools to ensure the feasibility of this new type of quantum software. To contribute to this goal, this paper provides a review of the main quantum software components and platforms. We also propose a set of quality requirements for the development of quantum software platforms and the conduct of their quality assessment.

    Serverless computing has emerged as an attractive deployment option for cloud applications in recent times. The unique features of this computing model include rapid auto-scaling, strong isolation, fine-grained billing options, and access to a massive service ecosystem, which autonomously handles resource management decisions. This model is increasingly being explored for deployments in geographically distributed edge and fog computing networks as well, due to these characteristics. Effective management of computing resources has always gained a lot of attention among researchers. The need to automate the entire process of resource provisioning, allocation, scheduling, monitoring, and scaling has resulted in the need for specialized focus on resource management under the serverless model. In this article, we
    identify the major aspects covering the broader concept of resource management in serverless environments and propose a taxonomy of elements that influence these aspects, encompassing characteristics of system design, workload attributes, and stakeholder expectations. We take a holistic view on serverless environments deployed across edge, fog, and cloud computing networks. We also analyse existing works discussing aspects of serverless resource management using this taxonomy. This article further identifies gaps in literature and highlights future research directions for improving capabilities of this computing model.

    discuss the objectives and the viability of the serverless paradigm along
    with challenges in each of those domains. We then classify those challenges
    into nine topics and survey the proposed solutions. Finally, we present the
    areas that need further attention from the research community and identify
    open problems.

    The advanced notebooks, mobile phones, and Internet applications in today's world that we use are all entrenched in classical communication bits of zeros and ones. Classical Internet has laid its foundation originating from the amalgamation of mathematics and Claude Shannon's theory of information. However, today's Internet technology is a playground for eavesdroppers. This poses a serious challenge to various applications that rely on classical Internet technology, and it has motivated the researchers to switch to new technologies that are fundamentally more secure. By exploring the quantum effects, researchers paved the way into quantum networks that provide security, privacy, and range of capabilities such as quantum computation, communication, and metrology. The realization of Quantum Internet (QI)
    requires quantum communication between various remote nodes through quantum channels guarded by quantum cryptographic protocols. Such networks rely upon quantum bits (qubits) that can simultaneously take the value of zeros and ones. Due to the extraordinary properties of qubits such as superposition, entanglement, and teleportation, it gives an edge to quantum networks over traditional networks in many ways. At the same time, transmitting qubits over long distances is a formidable task and extensive research is going on satellite-based quantum communication, which will deliver breakthroughs for physically realizing QI in near future. In this paper, QI functionalities, technologies, applications and open challenges have been extensively surveyed to help readers gain a basic understanding of the infrastructure
    required for the development of the global QI.

For each specified algorithm, QuRE estimates quantities such as number of physical qubits, execution time, probability of success of the computation, and physical gate counts for elementary quantum gate types of a specified technology. Out of the box, QuRE supports estimation for six physical quantum technologies, seven quantum algorithms, and with error correction using the Steane [1], [2], Bacon-Shor [3], Knill [4] or surface [5], [6] error correction codes.

    abstract = {
    In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) realm, efficient quantum circuit compilation is critical to ensure successful computation. Several third-party compilers are improving the compilation times and depth/gate counts. Untrusted third parties or a particular version of a trusted compiler may allow an attacker to steal, clone, and/or reverse engineer the quantum circuit. We propose to obfuscate quantum circuits by employing dummy CNOT gates to prevent such threats. If the adversary clones the obfuscated design, he/she will get faulty results. We propose a metric-based dummy gate insertion process to ensure maximum corruption of functionality measured using Total Variation Distance (TVD) and validated using IBM's noisy simulators. Our metric guided dummy gate insertion process achieves TVD of up to
    28.83\%, and performs 10.14\% better than the average TVD and performs within 12.45\% of the best obtainable TVD for the test benchmarks. The removal of dummy gates by the designer post-compilation to restore functionality as well as other finer details have been addressed.

    abstract = {Quantum computers are next-generation devices that hold promise to perform
    calculations beyond the reach of classical computers. A leading method
    towards achieving this goal is through quantum machine learning, especially
    quantum generative learning. Due to the intrinsic probabilistic nature of
    quantum mechanics, it is reasonable to postulate that quantum generative
    learning models (QGLMs) may surpass their classical counterparts. As such,
    QGLMs are receiving growing attention from the quantum physics and computer
    science communities, where various QGLMs that can be efficiently implemented
    on near-term quantum machines with potential computational advantages are
    proposed. In this paper, we review the current progress of QGLMs from the
    perspective of machine learning. Particularly, we interpret these QGLMs,
    covering quantum circuit Born machines, quantum generative adversarial
    networks, quantum Boltzmann machines, and quantum autoencoders, as the
    quantum extension of classical generative learning models. In this context,
    we explore their intrinsic relation and their fundamental differences. We
    further summarize the potential applications of QGLMs in both conventional
    machine learning tasks and quantum physics. Last, we discuss the challenges
    and further research directions for QGLMs.

We propose a speed benchmark, using an update to the quantum volume experiments that allows the measurement of Circuit Layer Operations Per Second (CLOPS) and identify how both classical and quantum components play a role in improving performance.

    abstract = {Security has always been a critical issue in machine learning (ML) applications. Due to the high cost of model training – such as collecting relevant samples, labeling data, and consuming computing power – model-stealing attack is one of the most fundamental but vitally important issues. When it comes to quantum computing, such a quantum machine learning (QML) model-stealing attack also exists and is even more severe because the traditional encryption method, such as homomorphic encryption can hardly be directly applied to quantum computation. On the other hand, due to the limited quantum computing resources, the monetary cost of training QML model can be even higher than classical ones in the near term. Therefore, a well-tuned QML model developed by a third-party company can be delegated to a quantum cloud
    provider as a service to be used by ordinary users. In this case, the QML model is likely to be leaked if the cloud provider is under attack. To address such a problem, we propose a novel framework, namely QuMoS, to preserve model security. Instead of applying encryption algorithms, we propose to divide the complete QML model into multiple parts and distribute them to multiple physically isolated quantum cloud providers for execution. As such, even if the adversary in a single provider can obtain a partial model, it does not have sufficient information to retrieve the complete model. Although promising, we observed that an arbitrary model design under distributed settings cannot provide model security. We further developed a reinforcement learning-based security engine, which can automatically optimize the
    model design under the distributed setting, such that a good trade-off between model performance and security can be made. Experimental results on four datasets show that the model design proposed by QuMoS can achieve a close accuracy to the model designed with neural architecture search under centralized settings while providing the highest security than the baselines.

  },
    series = {Middleware '23},
    address = {New York, NY, USA},
    abstract = {With the slowing of Moore's law and decline of Dennard scaling, computing
    systems increasingly rely on specialized hardware accelerators in addition to
    general-purpose compute units. Increased hardware heterogeneity necessitates
    disaggregating applications into workflows of fine-grained tasks that run on
    a diverse set of CPUs and accelerators. Current accelerator delivery models
    cannot support such applications efficiently, as (1) the overhead of managing
    accelerators erases performance benefits for fine-grained tasks; (2)
    exclusive accelerator use per task leads to underutilization; and (3)
    specialization increases complexity for developers.We propose adopting
    concepts from Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which has solved these challenges
    for general-purpose CPUs in cloud computing. Kernel-as-a-Service (KaaS) is a
    novel serverless programming model for generic compute accelerators that aids
    heterogeneous workflows by combining the ease-of-use of higher-level
    abstractions with the performance of low-level hand-tuned code. We evaluate
    KaaS with a focus on the breadth of the idea and its generality to diverse
    architectures rather than on an in-depth implementation for a single
    accelerator. Using proof-of-concept prototypes, we show that this programming
    model provides performance, performance efficiency, and ease-of-use benefits
    across a diverse range of compute accelerators. Despite increased levels of
    abstraction, when compared to a naive accelerator implementation, KaaS
    reduces completion times for fine-grained tasks by up to 96.0\% (GPU), 68.4\%
    (FPGA), 98.6\% (TPU), and 34.9\% (QPU) in our experiments.

Its unique features, such as superposition and entanglement, allow for speedup in certain computations compared to classical computers. In this paper, we show that incorporating quantum computing into a heterogeneous computation architecture is possible and potentially can greatly enhance the overall performance and efficiency of solving a wide range of problems. We propose a heterogeneous computation architecture that integrates quantum computing and classical computing. We describe how this architecture can be implemented using widely available opensource software and provide a reference implementation. We also discuss potential benefits and challenges. Our goal is to highlight the importance of seamless inclusion of quantum computing in the future of computation and how it can be achieved with tools we already have.},

Present-day photonic quantum computers3–7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8.

    journal = {Software: Practice and Experience},
    abstract = {Summary Quantum computing resources are predominantly accessible through cloud services, with a potential future shift to edge networks. This paradigm and the increasing global interest in quantum computing have amplified the need for efficient, adaptable resource management strategies and service models for quantum systems. However, many limitations in the quantum resources' quantity, quality, availability, and cost pose significant challenges for conducting research in practical environments. To address these challenges, we proposed iQuantum, a holistic and lightweight discrete-event simulation toolkit uniquely tailored to model hybrid quantum computing environments. We also present a detailed system model for prototyping and problem formulation in quantum resource management. Through rigorous empirical
    validation and evaluations using large-scale quantum workload datasets, we demonstrate the flexibility and applicability of our toolkit in various use cases. iQuantum provides a versatile environment for designing and evaluating quantum resource management policies such as quantum task scheduling, backend selection, hybrid task offloading, and orchestration in the quantum cloud-edge continuum. Our work endeavors to create substantial contributions to quantum computing modeling and simulation, empowering the creation of future resource management strategies and quantum computing's broader applications.
